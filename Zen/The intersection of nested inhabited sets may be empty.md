# The intersection of inhabited nested sets may be empty

Consider a strictly decreasing sequence $(S_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of inhabited subsets (i.e. such that $\0 \neq S_{n} \supsetneq S_{n+1}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$).
Then it is possible that #m/thm/set/naïve
$$
\begin{align*}
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty S_{n} = \0
\end{align*}
$$

However, [[The intersection of nested inhabited Hausdorff-compact sets is inhabited]].
