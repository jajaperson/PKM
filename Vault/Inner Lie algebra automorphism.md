[[Lie algebra automorphism]]
# Inner Lie algebra automorphism

An **inner automorphism** of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is given by $\mathrm{e}^{-\ad_{x}}$, where $\ad_{x}$ is the [[Adjoint Lie algebra representation|adjoint representation]] for some $x \in \mathfrak{g}$. #m/def/lie 
As the [[exponential of a derivation on a Lie algebra]] it is an [[Lie algebra automorphism|automorphism]].[^1972]
The set of all inner automorphisms $\Inn \mathfrak{g}$ forms a [[normal subgroup]] of $\Aut \mathfrak{g}$.
