# $\vab H$-field

The **$\vab H$-field** is an auxiliary field defined as
$$
\begin{align*}
\vab H = \frac{\vab{B}}{\mu_{0}} - \vab M
\end{align*}
$$
where $\vab B$ is the [[magnetic field]] and $\vab M$ is the [[Magnetic dipole moment|magnetization]].
$\vab H$ satisfies [[Ampère's law for magnets]] which is analogous to Ampère's law satisfied by $\vab B$,
however unlike $\vab B$ it is not in general divergenceless ($\vab{\nabla}\times\vab H = -\vab{\nabla} \times \vab M$).
