# OIcel progressive consonant assimilation

The inflectional ending <em class="ling">-r</em> is fully assimilated in the following cases

- `sr -> ss / _#`
  - <em class="recon">frýs + r</em> → <em class="ling">frýss</em> (from <em class="ling">frjósa</em>)
  - <em class="recon">laks + r</em> → <em class="recon">lakss</em> (→ <em class="ling">lax</em>)
- `lr -> ll / _#`
- `nr -> nn / _#`

Since this produces geminates, the result serves as an input for [[OIcel consonant shortening]].
If the preceding consonant is already geminate, assimilation only occurs in the case of <em class="ling">ss</em>:

- `ssr -> ss / _#`
- `llr -> llr / _#`
- `nnr -> nnr / _#` with exception of <em class="ling">mann</em>.

In words with short syllables the assimilation usually does not occur:

- <em class="ling">dalr</em>
- <em class="ling">svanr</em>
