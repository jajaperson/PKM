[[Unital associative algebra over a field]]
# Category of unital associative algebras

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a [[field]].
The **category of unital associative algebras** $\Ring_{\mathbb K}$ is a [[category]] where
an object is a [[Unital associative algebra over a field]] over $\mathbb K$
and a morphism is a [[Algebra homomorphism|unital algebra homomorphism]]. #m/def/falg
