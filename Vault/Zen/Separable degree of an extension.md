# Separable degree of an extension

Let $F:K$ be an [[Algebraic element|algebraic extension]].
The **separable degree** of $F:K$ is given by the number of embeddings of this extension into the [[algebraic closure]] $\overline{K}$, #m/def/field i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
[F:K]_{\mathrm{s}} := \abs{ \cat{Fld}_{K}(F,\overline{K}) }
\end{align*}
$$
and is nonzero assuming [[Zorn's lemma]], see [[Embedding an algebraic extension into an algebraically closed field]].
