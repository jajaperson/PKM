# Algebraically closed field

A field $\mathbb{K}$ is called **algebraically closed** iff it satisfies the following equivalent properties #m/def/ring 

1. every non-constant polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}[x]$  has a root, i.e. a solution to $p(x)=0$. ^A1
2. $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}[x]$ is an [[Polynomial ring#^irreducible]] iff it is linear, i.e. $\deg p = 1$ ^A2

## Examples and nonexamples

- [[Real numbers]] is not algebraically closed, since $x^2 + 1$ has no real root.
- [[Complex numbers]] is the closure of the real numbers.

## Properties

- [[Division algebra with only algebraic elements over an algebraically closed field]]
