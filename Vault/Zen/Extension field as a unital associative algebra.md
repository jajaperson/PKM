[[Unital associative algebra]]
# Extension field as a unital associative algebra

Let $K$ be a [[field]] and $L \leq K$ be a [[subfield]].
Then $K$ is a [[unital associative algebra]] over $L$. #m/thm/falg

> [!missing]- Proof
> #missing/proof

In fact, an [[extension field]] $L$ of $K$ is precisely a commutative unital associative division algebra over $K$.
