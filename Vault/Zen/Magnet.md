[[Magnetostatics MOC]]
# Magnet

A **magnet** is, generally speaking, an object which exhibits a [[magnetic field]].
Materials can produce magnetic fields by three main phenomena:

1. [[Paramagnetism]] — Induced magnetic field parallel to an external magnetic field
2. [[Diamagnetism]] — Induced magnetic field diametrically opposed to an external magnetic field
3. [[Ferromagnetism]] — Much stronger than paramagnetism

Many important properties of a magnet come from their [[Magnetic dipole moment|magnetization]] $\vab M$,
which is the density of their [[magnetic dipole moment]] $\vab m$.
This involves approximating a material as a continuous distribution of [[Perfect magnetic dipole|perfect magnetic dipoles]].
A magnet obeying a linear magnetization law is termed a [[Linear magnet]].
