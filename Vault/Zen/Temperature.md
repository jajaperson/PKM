# Temperature
In general, temperature is a measure of _average translational kinetic energy of particles_ — see [[Relationship between Kinetic Energy and Temperature]].

Temperature should always be measured using the Kelvin scale
Changes in temperature ($\Delta T$) can be measured with a thermoscope —
adding or subtracting temperature (by [[Heat]]) results in some _macroscopic change_.

For gases, temperature is ==only a meaningful quantity when the gas is in [[Thermal equilibrium]] with its environment== (the same goes for [[Pressure]]).
Temperature is defined by the [[Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics]] —
without this law it would be impossible to say 
that two objects shared a common quantity of temperature between them.
