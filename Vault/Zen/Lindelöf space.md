# Lindelöf space

The **Lindelöf** condition is a weakening of [[Compact space|compactness]] and [[Second countability axiom|second-countability]].
A topological space is Lindelöf iff every [[Cover set|open cover]] has a _countable_ subcover. #m/def/topology 

## Properties

- [[Second countable implies Lindelöf]]
