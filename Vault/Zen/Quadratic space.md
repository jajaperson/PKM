# Quadratic space

A **quadratic space** over $\mathbb{K}$ is a [[vector space]] over $\mathbb{K}$ equipped with a [[quadratic form]], or equivalently[^cav] a [[Bilinear form#^symmetric]] [[bilinear form]]. #m/def/linalg 

  [^cav]: [[Away from 2]], see [[Correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms away from 2]]
