[[Geometry MOC]]
# Differential geometry MOC

**Differential geometry** studies [[Differentiability|smooth]] geometric structures, in particular [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable manifolds]].
As such it is closely related to differential topology.
A guiding principle is the [[Linearization dogma]].

> [!info]- In an ambient space
> [[John Willard Milnor]] and [[Lyle Noakes]] take an approach where only [[Real embedded manifold|real embedded manifolds]] are considered, as justified by the [[Whitney embedding theorem]].
> 
> - [[Differentiability#Arbitrary subsets of real coördinate space|Differentiability on arbitrary subsets of real coördinate space]]
> - [[Tangent space#Real embedded manifold|Tangent space]]
> - [[Differential pushforward#Real embedded manifold|Differential pushforward]]

In these notes lowercase Latin indices are used for [[abstract index notation]] unless otherwise specified.

## Spaces

- [[Submanifold]]
- [[Tangent bundle]]
- [[Vector bundle]]

## Morphisms

- [[Immersion and submersion]]
- [[Bundle map]]
- [[Bundle section]]
- [[Vector bundle morphism]]

### Derived morphisms

- [[Differential pullback]], [[Differential pushforward]]

### Results

- [[Inverse function theorem#Corollary|Inverse function theorem]] gives a condition for local diffeomorphisms
- [[Preïmage theorem]] can be used to verify most constructions that are manifolds

## Attached data

- [[Tangent space]], [[Tangent bundle]]
- [[Cotangent space]], [[Cotangent bundle]]

## Calculus on manifolds

The fundamental objects of calculus on manifolds

- [[Scalar field]]
- [[Vector field]]
- [[1-form]]
- [[Tensor field]]
- [[Differential form]]
    - [[Volume form]], [[Riemannian volume form]]
- Some pain has been taken to make sure most of my definitions for [[Calculus of variations MOC]] work for manifolds.

## Differentiation

There are three main definitions of differentiation, which in some sense coïncide on [[scalar field|scalar fields]].

- [[Exterior derivative]]
- [[Covariant derivative]] via the [[Affine connexion]]
- [[Lie derivative]]

## Geometry

- [[Smooth geodesic]]

## Extra structure

- [[Semi-Riemannian manifold]]
- [[Oriented manifold]]
