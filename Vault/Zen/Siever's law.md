[[PIE syllabification of sonorants]]
# Siever's law
Siever's law, in its most simple formulation, can be stated as follows
>   **Siever's Law (simple version)** :: If a non-syllabic sonorant is preceded by a [[Heavy syllable]], it becomes syllabic.
<!--SR:!2023-11-29,80,190-->

where, in PIE, a ”heavy syllable” may be understood as one containing a long vowel and a terminal non-syllabic, 
or more than one terminal non-syllabic.[^2017]

[^2017]: 2017, [[@ringeProtoIndoEuropeanProtoGermanic2017|From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic]], pp. 18–19

- <em class="recon">nept-yó-s</em> → ==<em class="recon">neptiós</em>==
<!--SR:!2023-12-16,106,246-->

It appears that in all attested daughter languages the rule remained productive only for <em class="recon">/w/</em> and especially <em class="recon">/y/</em>.

It has been proposed that [[Lindeman's option]] may have arisen as a special case of Siever's law.
