[[Ring]]
# Division ring

A **division ring**[^de][^alt] is a [[ring]] in which every nonzero element is a [[Units and zero-divisors|multiplicative unit]].
See also [[Division algebra]].

[^de]: German _Divisionsring_.
[^alt]: Also called a **skew field** (German _Schiefk√∂rper_). I prefer the term division ring because a division ring is a ring, but a skew field is not necessarily a field.
