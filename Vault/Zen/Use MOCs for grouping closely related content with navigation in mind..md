[[Using Folders, MOCs and Tags]]
# Use MOCs for grouping closely related content with navigation in mind.
One of the main practical aims of [[Map of Content|MOCs]] is to allow for easy navigation from [[+Home]] towards a group of concepts,
especially when the exact destination is not yet known.
The secondary, but perhaps more important benefits of MOCs is that they encourage you to make connections
and to view a given group of concepts in different ways.
