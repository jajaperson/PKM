# Abelian category

An **abelian category** $\cat A$ is a [[pre√§belian category]] such that every [[monomorphism]] is a [[Kernels and cokernels|kernal]] and every [[epimorphism]] is a [[Kernels and cokernels|cokernel]]. #m/def/cat 
Thus in particular an abelian category is [[Enriched category|enriched]] over [[Category of abelian groups]] and admits finite [[Biproduct|biproducts]].

The prototypical example is [[Category of abelian groups]], or more generally [[Category of left modules]] for any [[ring]] $R$.
The [[Freyd-Mitchell theorem]] gives a sense in which _all_ abelian categories are categories of modules.

## Properties

- [[Exact functor on abelian categories]]

## Subtypes

- [[Spectral category]]
    - [[Semisimple category]]
        - [[Fusion category]]
