# Abelian category

An **abelian category** $\cat A$ is a [[Pre√§belian category]] such that every [[Monomorphism]] is a [[Kernel]] and every [[Epimorphism]] is a [[Cokernel]]. #m/def/cat 

The prototypical example is [[Category of abelian groups]], or more generally [[Category of left-modules]] for any [[ring]] $R$.
The [[Freyd-Mitchell theorem]] gives a sense in which _all_ abelian categories are categories of modules.
