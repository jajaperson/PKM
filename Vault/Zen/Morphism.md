# Morphism

A **morphism** is an element of some [[category]]. #m/def/cat 
Typically, it represents some kind of structure-preserving map between sets,
or a more abstract relationship between objects.
Morphisms have the important property that they may be composed to produce new morphisms.

## Classification

- [[Monomorphism]]
  - [[Regular monomorphism]]
  - [[Split monomorphism]]
- [[Epimorphism]]
  - [[Regular epimorphism]]
  - [[Split epimorphism]]
- [[Isomorphism]]
- [[Endomorphism]]
- [[Automorphism]]

In the following, arrows signify implication.

	Isomorphism==>Monomorphism:::internal-link
	Isomorphism==>Epimorphism:::internal-link
	Endomorphism==>Morphism:::internal-link

```


The same prefixes are used for specific morphisms, including [[Functor|functors]] and [[Natural transformation|natural transformations]].
