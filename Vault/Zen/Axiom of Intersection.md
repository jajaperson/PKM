# Axiom of Intersection

In typical [[material set theory]] such as [[ZF]], it is not necessary to take the existence of an intersection as an axiom, as it can be derived from the [[Axiom of Union]] and [[Specification Axiom Schema]].
That is, it is a theorem of [[ZF]] that #m/thm/set/zf 
$$
\begin{align*}
\vdash (\forall \shood \mathcal{E})(\exists \shood B)[x \in B \iff (\forall \shood X \in \mathcal{E})[x \in X]]
\end{align*}
$$
which is to say,
for any set $\mathcal{E}$ there exists an **intersection** $B$ consisting of the elements of elements of $\mathcal{E}$, which by [[Axiom of Extensionality|extensionality]] is unique, and we denote $\bigcap \mathcal{E}$.

## Axiom of Intersection for classes

For [[Class|classes]], on the other hand, the **Axiom of Intersection**[^2015] plays an imortant role in replacing the [[Specification Axiom Schema]]:
$$
\begin{align*}
(\forall \chood X)(\forall \chood Y)(\exists \chood Z)(\forall u)[u \in Z \iff u \in X \land u \in Y]
\end{align*}
$$
