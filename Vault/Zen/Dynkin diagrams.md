# Dynkin diagrams

The **Dynkin diagrams** are a collection of [[Types of graph|multidigraphs]] used to classify a number of mathematical objects.
A complete list is #m/def/graph 

![[Finite_Dynkin_diagrams.svg.png#invert]]
where an undirected edge corresponds to $(1,1)$ edges,
and directed doubles or triples consist of $(2,1)$ or $(3,1)$ edges respectively.
Related are the [[affine Dynkin diagrams]],
and of particular importance are the [[ADE graphs]], also called the _simply laced Dynkin diagrams_, which classify many more objects.
