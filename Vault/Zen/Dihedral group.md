# Dihedral group

The **dihedral group** $D_{2n}$ is the point symmetry group of an $n$-gon,
consisting of $n$ rotations and $n$ reflections. #m/def/group
Alternatively, it may be constructed as the [[semidirect product]] $\mathbb{Z}_{n} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{2}$,
where $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ represents the rotation group
and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ acts on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ by inversion.
