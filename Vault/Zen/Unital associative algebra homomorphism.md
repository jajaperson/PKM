# Associative algebra homomorphism

A **unital associative algebra homomorphism** is a [[Algebra homomorphism|unital algebra homomorphism]] of [[Unital associative algebra|associative algebras]], #m/def/falg 
i.e. $f:A\to B$ such that for $x,y \in A$ and $\lambda,\mu \in \mathbb{K}$

1. $f(\lambda x+\mu y) = \lambda f(x)+\mu f(y)$
2. $f(xy)= f(x)f(y)$
3. $f(1_{A})=1_{B}$

as such, an associative algebra homomorphism is also a [[ring homomorphism]].
