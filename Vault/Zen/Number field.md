# Number field

A **number field** $K$ is an [[Field extension|extension field]] of [[Rational numbers]] of finite [[Field extension|degree]] $[K : \mathbb{Q}]$, #m/def/num/alg
whence $K : \mathbb{Q}$ is an [[algebraic element|algebraic extension]].
Similarly, if $K : \mathbb{Q}$ is an arbitrary extension and $x \in K$ is [[Algebraic element|algebraic]] over $\mathbb{Q}$,
then [[Adjunction of a ring|$\mathbb{Q}(x)$]] is a number field,
and $x$ is called an **algebraic number**.[^2022]

In order to study a number field we often turn to study its [[Ring of integers of a number field|ring of integers]] and [[Ideal class group of a number field|ideal class group]].
