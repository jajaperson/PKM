# Paramagnetism
**Paramagnetism** is a kind of magnetism exhibited by certain substances.
It is similar to [[Ferromagnetism]] in that it is induced by an external magnetic field,
but it is a much weaker response due to weaker interactions between domains.

Like [[Ferromagnetism]], paramagnetism arises from unpaired electrons in the outer shell of an atom.
