# Linear quiver

A **$\mathbb{K}$-linear quiver** $\Gamma$ is a [[quiver]] whose vertices $\Gamma V$ are $\mathbb{K}$-[[Vector space|vector spaces]]
and whose edges $\Gamma E$ are $\mathbb{K}$-[[linear map|linear maps]] such that source and target are the domain and codomain respectively. #m/def/cat 
It follows a linear quiver is a [[Subquiver]] of some small [[subcategory]] of [[Category of vector spaces]].
