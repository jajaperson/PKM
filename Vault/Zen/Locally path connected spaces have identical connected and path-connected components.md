[[Local (path) connectedness]]
# Locally path connected spaces have identical connected and path-connected components

Let $X$ be a [[Local (path) connectedness|locally path-connected]] topological space.
Then for any $a,b \in X$,
$a$ is [[Path connectedness|path-connected]] to $b$
iff $a$ is [[Connectedness|connected]] to $b$. #m/thm/topology
