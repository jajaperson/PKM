[[Equivalence relation]]
# Partition
A **partition** divides a larger set into discrete chunks:
A partition $\{ T_{i} \}_{i \in I}$ of a set $T$ is a collection of subsets such that $T$ is the [[disjoint union]] of the partion. #m/def/set/na√Øve 
Every partition induces an [[Equivalence relation]],
where each chunk is taken as an equivalence class.
