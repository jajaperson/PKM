[[Cumulative distribution function]]
# Survival function

The **survival function** $S : \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ of a [[real random variable]] $T$ is defined by #m/def/prob 
$$
\begin{align*}
S(t) = \mathbb{P}(T > t) = 1- F_{T}(t)
\end{align*}
$$
It may be thought of as “the probability of survival beyond time $t$” when the random variable represents a time.
