[[My style guide]]
# When to use: tags, folders, MOCs?
In general

- [[Use tags for organised, but loose and fluid "categories" of otherwise unrelated notes.]] 
	Document them in the [[Tag Glossary]].
- [[Use folders for separating essentially different kinds of content.]]
- [[Use MOCs for grouping closely related content with navigation in mind.]]

## Workflows
- [[Deleting tags with `zerotag`]]
