# Lie group

A **Lie group** $G$ is a [[topological group]] $G$ on an [[differentiable manifold|analytic manifold]] $G$ such that the group operation $(\cdot) : G \times G \to G$ and the inverse map $(-)^{-1} : G \to G$ are [[Differentiability|analytic]]. #m/def/lie 
Equivalently, the map $gh \mapsto gh^{-1}$ is analytic.

> [!info]- Charts and atlases of a Lie group
> Due to properties of a Lie group as a [[Homogenous space]], it is possible to build an [[atlas]] for the entire group from a single [[coÃ¶rdinate chart]] $(U, \varphi)$.

Every Lie group has a corresponding [[Lie algebra]] given by the [[Tangent space]] at identity. #to/clarify
