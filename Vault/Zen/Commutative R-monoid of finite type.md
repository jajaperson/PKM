# Commutative $R$-monoid of finite type

A [[Commutative R-monoid]] $T$ being [[R-monoid of finite type|of finite type]] is equivalent to the existence of an $R$-monoid homomorphism #m/thm/calg
$$
\begin{align*}
R[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}] \twoheadrightarrow T
\end{align*}
$$
from the [[polynomial ring]] in $n$ indeterminates.

As such, these are just quotients of the [[polynomial ring]].

## Properties

- [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]
