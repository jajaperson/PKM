[[Physics MOC]]
# Thermodynamics MOC
Thermodynamics is the study of macroscopic quantities of matter
and their thermal properties.

Key topics are [[Heat]], 
[[Temperature]], 
[[Work]], 
[[Pressure]], 
[[Phase change]], 
State (see [[Macroscopic state variables of an ideal gas]]),
[[Energy]], 
[[Entropy]], 
&c.

Thermodynamics predates the atomic model.
[[Statistical thermodynamics MOC]] is a much newer theory which accounts the macroscopic properties seen in thermodynamics
using the microscopic atomic model.
