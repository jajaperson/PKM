# Incidence relation

**Incidence** is a [[Relation set|relation]] between geometric subspaces (points, lines, planes, &c.),
generalizing the notion of a point being on a line, a line being in a plane, a plane containing a line, &c.
In each case the subspaces are said to be **incident** with one another.
