# $\opn S(5,8,24)$

There exists a unique $\opn S(5,8,24)$ [[Steiner system]], #m/thm/comb
which is also called the **Witt design**.

## Construction

### From the Golay code

Let $\Omega$ denote a set of 24 points and $\mathcal{C} \leq \mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ be the $[24,12,8]_{2}$ [[extended binary Golay code]].
Then the **octads** of $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. codewords of [[Hamming distance|Hamming weight]] 8, form the octads of $\opn S(5,8,24)$.

> Now each octad accounts for ${8 \choose 5} = 56$ elements, and $759 \times 56 = 42\,502= {24\choose 5}$, 
> which exhausts all 5-element subsets.

## Properties

- Let $T_{0}$ be a 4-element subset of $\Omega$.
  Then $T_{0}$ lies in exactly 5 octads $\{ T_{0} \amalg T_{i} \}_{i=1}^5$ where $\{ T_{i} \}_{i=0}^5$ forms a [[partition]] of $\Omega$ into 4-element sets called a **sextet**, and the union of any two sets in a sextet form an octad.
- The automorphisms of $\opn S(5,8,24)$ are given by [[Mathieu group M24]].
