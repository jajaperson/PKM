# PIE declension

Nominals were declined for [[PIE case|case]], [[PIE grammatical number|number]], as well as [[PIE grammatical gender|gender]] for all except nouns.

## Concord classes

### Case and number
Case and number were reflected by long morphologized _fused_ endings, with no discernible case or number parts
(though it appears that the singular may originally have been unmarked).

### Gender

- Masculine is the unmarked gender.

- Feminine marked on non-substantive nominals by the ultimate derivational suffix, still preceding the case ending.

- Neuter was distinguished by all nominals but only in the ==nominative, accusative, and vocative== cases, in which the case endings differed. <!--SR:!2023-11-08,7,170-->
