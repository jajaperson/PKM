# Galois field
A **Galois field** is a field containing a finite number of elements. #m/def/ring
The [[cardinality]] of a field is called its **order**,
and finite fields **only exist** for orders of the form $p^h$ where $p$ is prime.
The Galois field of order $p^h$, **unique** up to isomorphism, is denoted $\mathbb{F}_{p^h}$ or $\mathrm{GF}(p^h)$. #m/thm/ring
Clearly every Galois field is in particular a [[Field of prime characteristic]].

## Construction and uniqueness

Let $q = p^h$ be a where $h,p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $h$ is prime.
Then $x^q - x \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ is a [[separable polynomial]].
Moreover, a field $F$ has precisely $q$ elements iff it is the [[splitting field]] of $x^q-x$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, #m/thm/field 
whence follows uniqueness.[^2009]

> [!tip]- Direct construction as quotient by a polynomial
> A finite field of a given order can be constructed as a quotient of a [[polynomial ring]].
> Given a polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$
> and an irreducible polynomial $f$ of degree $h$,
> then $\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x] / \langle f \rangle$ is a field of order $p^h$. #m/thm/ring 
## Properties

Let $K = \GF(p^h)$. Then

1. $K$ is a [[perfect field]], and consequently, irreducible polynomials in $K[x]$ are separable. ^P1

> [!check]- Proof of 1
> Since the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] is injective ([[Field homomorphisms are injective]]), by the [[Pigeonhole principle]] it must also be surjective, proving [[#^P1]]. <span class="QED"/>
