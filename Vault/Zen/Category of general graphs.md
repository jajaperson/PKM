# Category of general graphs

The **category of general graphs** $\cat{Grph}$ is a [[category]] where
an object is a [[Graph|general graph]]
and a morphism is a [[graph homomorphism]]. #m/def/graph 

## Important functors

- $\opn V : \cat{Grph} \to \Set$ gives the underlying vertex set of a graph, and the underlying vertex map of a graph homomorphism.
- [[Equivalence of quivers and general graphs]]

## Subcategories

- [[Category of simple graphs]]
