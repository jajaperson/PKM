[[Abstract algebra MOC]]
# Group theory MOC

**Group theory** is predominantly concerned with symmetry, and its algebraic representation as a [[group]], the fundamental object of study.

## Fundamentals

- [[Group]]
- [[Group order]]

## Morphisms

- [[Group homomorphism]]
  - [[Kernel of a group homomorphism]]
 - [[Group action]]
   - [[Group representation theory MOC]]

## Internally

- [[Conjugation by an element]]
  - [[Group class function]]
- [[Coset]]
- [[Torsion group]]

### Commutation

- [[Abelian group]]
- [[Centre of a group]]
- [[Centralizer of a group element]], [[Centralizer of a subgroup]]
- [[Group commutator]]


## Externally

- [[Subgroup]] (subobjects) [[Quotient group]] (quotient objects)
  - [[Cyclic subgroup]]
  - [[Normal subgroup]]
- [[Direct product of groups]] (product) [[Free product of groups]] (coproduct)
- [[Semidirect product]]

### Functors in

- [[Free group]]
- [[Group presentation]]

## Types of group

- [[Finite group]]
- [[Simple group]]
- [[Topological group]]
  - [[Discrete group]]
  - [[Compact group]]
  - [[Lie group]]
