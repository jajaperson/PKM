# PIE case system
As in many daughter languages,
PIE case was a non-lexically governed concord class affecting nominals.
Each case more or less represented a different function,
though with much overlap especially in later stages and daughters.[^2017]

[^2017]: [[@ringeProtoIndoEuropeanProtoGermanic2017|From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic]], p. 25 (§2.3.2)
