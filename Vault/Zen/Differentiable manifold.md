# Differentiable manifold

A $k$-**differentiable manifold** or $C^k$-manifold $(M, \mathscr{A})$ is a [[topological manifold]] equipped with a maximal $C^\alpha$-[[atlas]].[^1]

## Embedded manifolds

By the [[Whitney embedding theorem]], we may alternatively consider $C^k$-manifolds as embedded into [[real co√∂rdinate space]], i.e. as a [[Real embedded manifold]].

[^1]: In particular, a $C^0$-manifold is a [[topological manifold]] with an atlas.
