# Differentiable manifold

A $k$-**differentiable manifold** or $C^k$-manifold is a [[topological manifold]] with an additional $C^k$-[[atlas]], i.e. an atlas with $k$-[[Differentiability#Real coördinate spaces|differentiable]] [[Transition map|transition maps]]. #m/def/geo/diff

- $C^\omega$-manifold or **analytic manifold** only has transition maps that can be written as a power series.

## Embedded manifolds

By the [[Whitney embedding theorem]], we may alternatively consider $C^k$-manifolds as embedded into [[real coördinate space]], i.e. as a [[Real embedded manifold]].
