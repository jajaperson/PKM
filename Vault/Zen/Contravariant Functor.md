[[Functor]]
# Contravariant functor
A contravariant functor (as opposed to a [[Functor|covariant functor]]) behaves very much like a covariant functor,
except for the fact that it _flips morphisms_.
Because of this, a contravariant functor $F$ from $\cat C$ to $\cat D$ is equivalent to a functor from the [[Opposite category]] of $\cat C$.
$$
F: \cop C \to \cat D
$$
