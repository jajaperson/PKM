# Condition for a quotient commutative ring to be a field

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and $I \trianglelefteq R$ be an [[ideal]].
Then the [[quotient ring]] $R / I$ is a [[field]] iff $I$ is a [[Maximal ideal]]. #m/thm/ring

As a corollary, a ring is a field iff it has no nontrivial proper ideals. ^C1
