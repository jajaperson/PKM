[[Algebraic element]]
# All elements of a finite-dimensional unital associative algebra are algebraic

Let $A$ be a [[unital associative algebra]] over a field $\mathbb{K}$,
If $A$ is finite dimensional then every element in $A$ is algebraic, since the series $\{a^i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is linearly dependent. #m/thm/falg
