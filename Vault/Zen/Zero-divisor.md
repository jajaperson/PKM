# Zero-divisor

Let $R$ be a [[ring]].
A left (right) **zero-divisor** is an element $z \in R$ which sends some nonzero element to zero when multiplying on the left (right), #m/def/ring 
i.e. $z a = 0$ ($az = 0$) for some $a \in R$ with $a \neq 0$.

## As morphisms

Let $\cat{R}$ denote the multiplicative monoid of a ring $R$ viewed as a [[category]].
Then $a \in R$ is

- a **left-zero-divisor** iff it is not [[Monomorphism|monic]]
- a **right-zero-divisor** iff it is not [[Epimorphism|epic]]
