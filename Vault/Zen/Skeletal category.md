# Skeletal category
A **skeletal category** is a category in which a morphism $f$ is an [[Isomorphism]] iff it is an [[Automorphism]]. #m/def/cat 
Given a category $\cat C$, we may define the [[Skeleton category]] $\opn{Sk} \cat C$ by collapsing isomorphism classes of objects.

## Properties

- [[Skeletal categories are equivalent iff they are isomorphic]]
