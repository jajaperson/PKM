# Unimodular group

A [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] $G$ is called **unimodular** iff its left and right [[Haar measure|Haar measures]] agree[^scal]. #m/def/group

[^scal]: Up to multiplication by a positive constant. Equivalently, it is possible to normalise so that $\mu_{L} = \mu_{R} = \mu$.


## Examples

- Finite groups
- Compact Lie groups â€” See [[Haar measure of a compact Lie group]]
