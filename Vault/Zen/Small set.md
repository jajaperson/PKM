[[Set theory MOC]]
# Small set

The precise meaning of **small set** depends on the choice of [[axiomatic set theory]] being used.
In [[ZFC]] and its [[conservative extension|conservative extensions]] (e.g. [[NBG]]),
the term merely emphasises that a [[set]] is not a [[Proper class]].
In foundations with universes such as [[TG]], a set $x$ is **small** with respect to a universe $U$ if $x \in U$. #m/def/set/tg
