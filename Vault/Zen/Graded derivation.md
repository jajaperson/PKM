[[Derivation on an algebra]]
# Graded derivation

A graded derivation is a generalization of a [[derivation on an algebra]].
Let $(A, \cdot)$ be a [[graded algebra]] over $\mathbb{K}$.
A degree $p$ **graded derivation** is a [[Homomorphism of graded vector spaces#^homogenous]] [[linear endomorphism]] $D : A \to A$ satisfying the generalized [[product rule]] #m/def/falg 
$$
\begin{align*}
D(a \cdot b) = D(a) \cdot b + (-1)^{pq} \, a \cdot D(b)
\end{align*}
$$
for homogenous $a \in A$ of degree $q$.
