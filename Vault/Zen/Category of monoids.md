# Category of monoids
The category of monoids $\cat{Mon}$ is a category where an object is a [[Monoid]] and morphism is a [[Monoid homomorphism]].
Since [[A monoid is a category with one object]],
and monoid homomorphisms behave like functors on these monoid categories,
it follows that $\cat{Mon}$ is a restricted version of $\Cat$.
