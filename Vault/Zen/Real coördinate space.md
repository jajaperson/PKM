# Real coördinate space

**Real coördinate space** $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of $n$-tuples of real numbers.

## Topological properties

Considered as either a [[metric topology]] or [[product topology]], $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the following properties

- [[Heine-Borel theorem]]: Subsets compact iff closed and bounded.
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [[Path connectedness|arc-connected]], thus [[Path connectedness|path-connected]] and [[Connectedness|connected]].

## Smooth properties

See [[Infinitesimal calculus MOC]].

## Geometric properties

Real coördinate space is commonly considered with the geometry of [[Euclidean space]].
