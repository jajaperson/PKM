# Finite $R$-ring

An $R$-ring (or [[ring extension]]) $T$ is called **finite** iff $T$ is [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as an $R$-module, #m/def/ring 
i.e. there exists an onto $R$-[[module homomorphism]]
$$
\begin{align*}
R^{(n)} \twoheadrightarrow T
\end{align*}
$$
for some $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$.
This should not be confused with the weaker condition of [[Finite type R-ring]].[^2009]
