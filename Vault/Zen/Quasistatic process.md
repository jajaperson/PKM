[[Thermodynamics MOC]]
# Quasistatic process
A **quasistatic** or **quasiëquilibrium** process which is carried out ‘so slowly’ that it remains in [[Thermal equilibrium]] at every step.
This means that macroscopic quantities such as [[Temperature]] and [[Pressure]] are measurable/meaningful at all points in time.

Since every hypothetically infinitesimal step in a quasi-static process is reversible,
a quasi-static process is a [[Reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible process]].

## Properties
- [[Quasistatic expression for work]]
- [[First law of thermodynamics#^Quasistatic]]
