# History of Category Theory
The following is a brief history of category theory, given by [[Steve Awodey]][^2010]

  [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] originate the theory in their paper [[@eilenbergGeneralTheoryNatural1945|General theory of natural equivalences]].
- **Late 1940s** 
  The main applications were originally in the fields of [[Algebraic Topology]],
  particularly homology theory, and [[Abstract algebra MOC]].
- **1950s** 
  [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and others begin applying category theory to [[Algebraic Geometry]].
