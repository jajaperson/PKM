[[Unital associative algebra]]
# Unital associative subalgebra

A **unital (associative) subalgebra** $B$ of an [[unital associative algebra]] $A$ is a [[Subalgebra over a field|subalgebra]] $B \leq A$ containing the identity, #m/def/falg 
i.e. $B$ is itself an associative algebra; $B \cdot B \sube B$ and $\mathbb{1} \in B$.

## Properties

- The [[commutator]] algebra of an associative subalgebra is a [[Lie subalgebra]]
