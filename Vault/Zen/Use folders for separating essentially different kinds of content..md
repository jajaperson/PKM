[[Using Folders, MOCs and Tags]]
# Use folders for separating essentially different kinds of content.
There is an _essential_ difference between the notes I take on sources (`Sources/`), 
general notes (`Zen/`),
and journal entries (`Timestamps/`).
They are different kinds of content.

In general, I keep the number of folders low so as not to get in the way of notes themselves.
