# PIE laryngeal deletion
PIE laryngeals were deleted in a number of circumstances when not adjacent to a syllabic.[^2017]

- A _laryngeal_ separated from an <em class="recon">o</em> by a _sonorant_, all in the same syllable was deleted.
  Since in some categories the <em class="recon">o</em> grade is more common, this can mean an underlying <em class="recon">H</em> rarely surfaces.
  - e.g. <em class="recon">terh₁-</em> ‘bore’, <em class="recon">tórmos</em> ‘borehole’
  - <em class="recon">/o-yh₁-/</em>, the [[PIE verb stem formation#Mood|Core IE thematic optative]].
- **Pinault's rule** A _laryngeal_ preceded by a (underlying) _non-syllabic_ followed by an (underlying)_ \*/y/_ is deleted.[^wiki]
  - e.g. imperfective stem of root <em class="recon">werh₁-</em> ‘to say’ is <em class="recon">wéry(e/o)-</em>
  - imperfective stem of root <em class="recon">h₂arh₃-</em> ‘to plow’ is <em class="recon">h₂ary(e/o)-</em>
  - contrast with imperfective stem of root <em class="recon">snéh₁-</em> ‘to spin’ is <em class="recon">sneh₁ye/o-</em>
- A _laryngeal_ in the position `C_CC` is dropped
  i.e. /C_CC/ > /CCC/.
  - e.g. <em class="recon">/dʰugh₂tr-/</em> → <em class="recon">dʰugtr-</em>
- An utterance-final _laryngeal_ was deleted (after [[PIE *e-laryngeal colouring]]) if preceded by a syllabic.
  A vocative constitutes a complete utterance.
  Remains productive in Rigvedic.
    - e.g. <em class="recon">/-ah₂/</em> → voc. <em class="recon">-a</em>.
