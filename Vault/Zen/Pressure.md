[[Thermodynamics MOC]]
# Pressure
Pressure ($p: \pu{N m-2 = Pa}$) is a measure of the force applied perpendicular to a two-dimensional, surface,
e.g. the force per square meter applied to the container of a gas.
$$
\begin{align*}
p = \frac{F}{A}
\end{align*}
$$
or, with vectors
$$
\begin{align*}
\vab F = p \vab A
\end{align*}
$$
Like [[Temperature]], the pressure of a gas is only a measurable/meaningful quantity 
when the gas is in [[Thermal equilibrium]].
