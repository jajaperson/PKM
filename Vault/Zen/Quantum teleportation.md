# Quantum teleportation

**Quantum teleportation** is the transfer of a quantum state between two parties without knowledge of the state to be transferred or the location of the receiver.[^1993]

In the typical scenario, Alice wants to transfer 1 qubit $\ket{\psi}_{1}$ of information to Bob,
and the two happen to already possess an entangled pair of particles
By applying operations to $\ket{\psi}_{1}$ and her member of the entangled pair,
taking appropriate measurements,
and communicating the results to Bob,
Bob is able to apply operations to his entangled particle to reproduce the state of $\ket{\psi}_{1}$ faithfully.
During the process the state of the original particle $\ket{\psi}_{1}$ is destroyed,
thus the [[No-cloning theorem]] is not violated.[^2011]
