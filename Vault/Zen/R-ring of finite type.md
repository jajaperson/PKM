# $R$-ring of finite type

An $R$-ring (or [[ring extension]]) $T$ is called **of finite type** iff it has finitely many generators, as an $R$-ring, #m/def/ring
or equivalently there exists an onto $R$-ring homomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
R \langle x_{1},\dots,x_{n} \rangle \twoheadrightarrow T
\end{align*}
$$
from the [[Free R-ring]].
In particular, see the special case of [[Commutative R-ring of finite type]].
