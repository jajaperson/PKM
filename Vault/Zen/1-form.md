[[Differential geometry MOC]]
# 1-form

Let $(M, \mathscr{A})$ be a $C^\alpha$-[[Differentiable manifold|manifold]].
A **1-form** or **covector field** is something which eats [[vector field|vector fields]] and spits out scalar fields in a linear fashion.
#m/def/geo/diff 
In more precise terms, a 1-form is a $C^\alpha(M)$-[[module homomorphism]]
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^\alpha(M).
\end{align*}
$$
 
## As a section

The above definition is equivalent to a $C^\alpha$-[[Bundle section|section]] of the [[cotangent bundle]].
As a special case of [[Differential form]], we denote the set of 1-forms on $M$ as
$$
\begin{align*}
\Omega^1(M) := \Gamma(T^*M).
\end{align*}
$$
At a point, each 1-form restricts to an $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear form]] on the tangent space, i.e. a [[Cotangent space|cotangent vector]].
