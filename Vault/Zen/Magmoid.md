# Magmoid

A **magmoid**[^aka] is the [[Oidification]] of a [[magma]].
A (small) magmoid $\mathscr{M}$ consists of #m/def/algebra 

- a set of objects $\Ob(\mathscr M)$
- for every pair of objects $X,Y \in \Ob(\mathscr M)$ a set of arrows $\mathscr M(X,Y)$
- an operation $(\odot)$ so that given $\alpha \in \mathscr M(X,Y)$ and $\beta \in \mathscr M(Y,Z)$ we have $\beta \odot \alpha \in \mathscr M(X,Z)$

  [^aka]: Also **partial magma**

See [[Magmoid homomorphism]] and [[Category of magmoids]].
