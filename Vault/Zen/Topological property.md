[[Topology MOC]]
# Topological property
A **topological property** is any property preserved under homeomorphism. #m/def/topology 
In general, any property that can be defined in terms of open neighbourhoods only is topological, since these are preserved by homeomorphism.

Since [[Functors encode invariants of isomorphism classes]], the value an arbitrary functor $F : \Top \to \cat C$ assigns to _any_ topological space is immediately a topological property.

A related concept is a [[Local property]], which is preserved under [[Local homeomorphism]].
