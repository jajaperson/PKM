[[PIE morphology MOC#Verb morphosyntactic categories]]
# PIE verb voice
Unlike the other morphosyntactic categories of verbs in PIE,
the overall structure of the voice system has its reflex in [[A probable cladistic tree of IE|Nuclear IE]] virtually unchanged.
There were two voices

- **Active voice** — The default voice
- **Mediopassive voice** — Used in the following cases
  1. To mark the verb of a passive clause
  2. For reflexive or reciprocal implications
  3. Lexically marked [[PIE deponent verb|deponent]] verbs

There is also evidence to suggest that the Nuclear IE [[PIE aspect|perfect aspect]] did not take the mediopassive voice.[^2017]
