[[Quasistatic process]]
# Work done by a gas during a quasi-static volume change
A volume change, 
i.e. the contraction or expansion of a container,
is a mechanical change â€”
and therefore any energy transferred due to this process will be **work**.
The amount of work due to an infinitesimal quasistatic volume change is
$$
\begin{align*}
\dj W &= -p \, dV
\end{align*}
$$
where $\dj W < 0$ for an expansion and $\dj W > 0$ for a compression.
