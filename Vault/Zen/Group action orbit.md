[[Group action]]
# Orbit

Given an [[Group action|action]] of a group $G$ on a set $M$,
the **orbit**[^Bahn] $Gm$ of a point $m \in M$ is the set of points that $m$ may be mapped to when acted upon, i.e. #m/def/group 
$$
\begin{align*}
Gm = \{ gm : g \in G \}
\end{align*}
$$
[^Bahn]: German _Bahn_

## Properties

- [[Orbit cardinality divides the finite order of the group element]]
- [[Orbit-stabilizer theorem]]
- Since orbits partition $X$, one can form an [[orbit space]].
- If $Gm = M$ the action is said to be [[Transitive group action|transitive]].
