# PKM MOC

Pretty much all my notes go into one folder, called `Zen/` for no reason other than it starting with the letter Z so it sits at the bottom.
When I take notes during a lecture it goes in `Lecture notes/`, with the intention of later distilling these into standalone notes in `Zen/`.
`Sources/` is used for notes generated from Zotero,
and `Timestamps/` is used for daily, weekly, yearly notes &c.
When a new note is created, it is usually in the root directory, and I only move it to `Zen/` when I'm happy with it.

```txt

└── +Home
```

Instead of using folders to organize around topics I use [[Map of Content|Maps of content]] (MOCs).
I also like to give all my notes “parents‘ by placing a link above the main heading (see [[Breadcrumb]]).

The layout of my PKM is largely based on [[LYT™️]].
