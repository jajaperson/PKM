The $[7,4,3]_{2}$ [[Hamming code]] is the smallest [[perfect code]]. #m/def/code

- The row space of the [[Incidence relation#Incidence matrix]] of the [[Fano plane]] with the $\vab 1$ codeword added.
- The code whose [[Linear code#^check]] consists of the [[homogenous co√∂rdinates]] of all points in the [[Fano plane]] as columns.
