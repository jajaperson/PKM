# Extensive and intensive parameters

Consider two thermodynamic systems $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ with parameters $E_{i},T_{i},V_{i},p_{i}$, &c.
An **extensive parameter** $E_{i},V_{i}$ is additive if the two systems are combined.
An **intensive parameter** $T_{i},p_{i}$ remains unchanged if a single system is _doubled_,
i.e. cloned and brought into thermal contact with its clone.
