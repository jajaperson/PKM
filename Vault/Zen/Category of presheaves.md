# Category of presheaves

The **category of presheaves** $\Set^{\cop C}$ is a [[category]] where
an object is a [[Presheaf]]
and a morphism is a [[natural transformation]]. #m/def/cat 
Thus it is a particular example of a [[functor category]].

## Properties

- By the [[Yoneda embedding]], $\cat C$ is a [[Subcategory|full subcategory]] of $\Set^{\cop C}$
