[[Compact space]]
# Heine-Borel theorem

The **Heine-Borel** characterizes compact subsets of [[Real coÃ¶rdinate space]].
Let $S \sube \mathbb{R^n}$.
Then $S$ is [[Compact space|compact]] iff it is [[Topological space|closed]] and [[Bounded set|bounded]]. #m/thm/topology

> One may construct a sequence $(x_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ such that $x_{k} \in T_{k}$,

> and by openness there exists open ball $\mathrm{B}_{\epsilon}(x) \sube U_{\beta}$.
> For sufficiently large $k$, $T_{k} \sube \mathrm{B}_{\epsilon}(x) \sube U_{\beta}$,
> whence $\{ U_{\beta} \}$ is a finite subcover of $T_{k}$, a contradiction.
> Therefore $T_{0}$ is compact, so $K$ is compact.

An alternate proof follows from [[Tikhonov's theorem]].
