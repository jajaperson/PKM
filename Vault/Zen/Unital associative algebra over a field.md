[[Algebra over a field]]
# Unital associative algebra

A **$\mathbb{K}$-ring** is an [[algebra over a field]] $\mathbb{K}$ for which the bilinear product possesses a two-sided identity $1$ and is associative #m/def/falg 

- $1 a = a 1 = a$ for all $a \in A$
- $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all $a,b,c \in A$

Hence it is also called a **unital associative algebra** over $\mathbb{K}$.
In other words, an associative algebra is a field action on a [[ring]].
An algebra homomorphism which preserves the identity is a [[Algebra homomorphism|unital algebra homomorphism]] or **$\mathbb{K}$-ring homomorphism**.
A generalization is an [[Unital associative algebra over a commutative ring|$R$-ring]].
