[[Ideal]]
# Prime ideal

A (two-sided) proper [[ideal]] $\mathfrak{p} \triangleleft R$ is called a **prime ideal** iff for any $a,b \in R$, $ab \in \mathfrak{p}$ implies $a \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $b \in \mathfrak{p}$[^2017], #m/def/ring i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{p} \ni ab \iff [\mathfrak{p} \ni a] \lor [\mathfrak{p} \ni b]
\end{align*}
$$

Note an ideal $I \trianglelefteq \mathbb{Z}$ is prime iff $I = p\mathbb{Z}$ where $p$ is prime or zero.
The set of all prime ideals of a commutative ring is called its [[Spectrum of a ring|spectrum]].
