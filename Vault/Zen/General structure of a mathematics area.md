[[Mathematics MOC]]
# General structure of a mathematics area

It is typical that an area of mathematics busies itself with a specific [[category]],
therefore an MOC for subarea of maths should generally have the following structure.

1. **Objects** — Outlines the _object of study_ and some basic properties of it.
2. **Morphisms** — How these objects relate to each other
3. **Internally** — Things constructed “inside” the object, e.g. subsets of a space.
4. **Externally** — The creation of objects from other objects, usually by category-theoretic constructions.

## MOCs following this structure

- [[Category theory MOC]] dogfooding itself
- [[Topology MOC]]
- [[Group theory MOC]]
