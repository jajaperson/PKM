# Map of Content

A **map of content** is a note whose main purpose is to organize other notes around a particular topic.
These play the role of folders in more standard organization structures, but have the benefit that a note may be listed in multiple MOCs and the layout of an MOC is customizable.

## Examples

For some good examples, see [[Topology MOC]] or [[Electrodynamics MOC]].
