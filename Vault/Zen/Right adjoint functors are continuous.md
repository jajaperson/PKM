[[Adjoint functor]]
# Right adjoint functors are continuous

Suppose we have an [[Adjoint functor|adjunction of functors]] $F \dashv U : \cat D \leftrightarrows \cat C$.
Then $U$ is a [[Continuity and cocontinuity|continuous functor]]
and $F$ is a [[Continuity and cocontinuity|cocontinuous functor]]. #m/thm/cat
