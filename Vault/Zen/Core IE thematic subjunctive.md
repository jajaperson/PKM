[[PIE mood]]
# Core thematic subjunctive
In PIE, the so-called [[PIE thematic vowel]] was meaningless in all categories,
except for the construction of the [[subjunctive mood]][^201715],
which could be constructed by appending such a thematic vowel to an [[Ablaut|e-grade]] verb stem.

- e.g. aorist indicative of ‘to step‘ (stepped) has 3sg. <em class="recon">gʷém-d</em>, 3pl. <em class='recon'>gʷ-ménd</em>;
  subjunctive has 3sg. <em class='recon'>gʷém-e-ti</em>, 3pl. <em class='recon'>gʷém-o-nti</em>.

## Double-thematic
In cases where the stem itself is thematic,
the meaningless thematic vowel and the appended thematic vowel contract
so that an apparent lengthened thematic vowel is present.

- e.g. present indicative of ‘to walk’ has 3sg. <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-sḱé-ti</em>, 3pl. <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-sḱó-nti</em>;
  subjunctive has 3sg. <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-sḱḗ-ti</em> ← <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-sḱé-e-ti</em>, 3pl. <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-skṓ-nti</em> ← <em class='recon'>gʷṃ-sḱó-o-nti</em>.[^201715][^sk]

[^201715]: 2017\. [[Sources/@ringeProtoIndoEuropeanProtoGermanic2017|From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic]], p. 15
[^sk]: The thematic suffix <em class='recon'>ské-ti</em> has a durative or iterative meaning.
