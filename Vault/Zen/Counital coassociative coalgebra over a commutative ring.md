# $R$-coring

Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
An **$R$-coring** $T$ is a [[Comonoid object|comonoid]] in [[Category of modules over a commutative ring|$\lMod{R}$]].
More concretely, an $R$-coring is an $R$-[[Coälgebra]] which is coünital and coässociative. #m/def/calg

## Sweedler notation

It is convenient to introduce **Sweedler notation**, where we write
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta a = \sum_{(a)}a_{(1)} \otimes a_{(2)}.
\end{align*}
$$
The idea is that the tensor $\Delta a$ may be decomposed into a finite sum of separable tensors,
so we feel free to invoke such a decomposition without fixing it explicitly.
