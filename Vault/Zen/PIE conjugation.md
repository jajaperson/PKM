[[PIE morphology MOC]]
# PIE conjugation
Verbs were conjugated for tense/[[PIE mood|mood]], [[PIE voice|voice]], [[PIE aspect|aspect]], as well as the [[PIE person system|person]] and [[PIE grammatical number|number]] of the subject.
In strict PIE these were almost exclusively reflected by single polyfunctional morphemes (endings) in a similar vain to [[PIE declension]],
which was inherited unchanged by the Anatolian branch.

```txt
root + ending
\____verb___/
```

By Nuclear IE the derivational affixes previously used for converting verbs from one [[PIE aspect|aspect]] to another had become more inflectional.
Similarly, the innovative subjunctive and optative moods were reflected by affixes,
yielding the following structure.

```txt
root + aspect? + mood? + ending
\________stem________/        /
 \____________verb___________/
```

Some reconstruct the so-called **augment** prefix <em class="recon">é-</em> for Central IE, 
but Ringe argues this did not exist for any ancestor of [[Proto-Germanic]].[^intro]

[^intro]: 2017, [[@ringeProtoIndoEuropeanProtoGermanic2017|From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic]], p. 30

In general, PIE conjugation had two phases

1. [[PIE verb stem formation]] encoding aspect and later mood
2. [[PIE verb endings]] encoding everything else

Ringe notes that the thematic stem inflections would have been easier to learn,
and certainly the majority of verbs became thematic in Proto-Germanic.[^foreshadowing]

## Core IE paradigm architecture

- Verbs with only one aspect stem — Always unaffixed.
- Verbs with two or three aspect stems — One unaffixed aspect, the rest affixed.
- Derived verbs — Only imperfective, always affixed.[^par]
