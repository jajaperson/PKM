# Centraliser of a group element
The **centralizer** $C(a)$ of an element $a \in G$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$ containing all elements that commute with $a$,
i.e. $C(a) = \{ b \in G \mid ab = ba \}$.[^gallian] #m/def/group #m/thm/group

A related notions include the [[Centralizer of a subgroup]], which extends notion to elements which commute with a set of elements,
and the [[Centre of a group]],
which includes only those elements that commute with all group elements.

## Additional properties

- Clearly the centraliser itself need not be abelian,
  since the centraliser of any $z \in Z(G)$ will be the entire group.
  For example, in the non-abelian group $D_{4}$, the centraliser $C(R_{180^ยบ}) = D_{4}$.
