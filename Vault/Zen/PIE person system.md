# PIE person system
PIE pronouns fell under one of three persons,
which inflected finite forms of verbs.
Additionally all nouns were third person, as in English.
Since PIE was a [[Pro-drop and non-Pro-drop languages|Null subject language]],
person was often _only_ reflected by the verb,
as with [[PIE grammatical number]].
