# Homogenous polynomial

A **homogenous polynomial** or **algebraic form** is a [[Polynomial]] whose nonzero terms all have the same degree. #m/def/general 
Thus a polynomial is an algebraic form of degree $n$ iff it is a [[homogenous function]] of degree $n$.
A form of degree 1 is a [[Linear form]],
and a form of degree 2 is a [[Quadratic form]].
