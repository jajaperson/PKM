[[Centre of a group]]
# Unique group involutions are central

If a group has a single unique involution (element $a$ of order $\abs a = 2$)
then that involution is in the groupâ€™s centre,
i.e. it commutes with every element $x$ so that $ax = xa$. #m/thm/group

From the above proof it is clear this statement extends to any order.

> According to [this StackExchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/821589) this is an example of a broader phenomenon where [[All group elements with a unique property are central]].
