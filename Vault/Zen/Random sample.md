# Random sample
A **random sample** is a collection of [[Independence of random variables|independent]] random variables $\{ X_{j} \}_{j=1}^n$
that share the same distribution.
The set of all possible variables to sample is called the **population**,
and for a sample to be random intuitively means that the sample is a fair representation of the whole population.
A random sample may be used to generate a [[Statistic]].
