[[Graded vector space]]
# Strict category of graded vector spaces

Let $S$ be a [[set]] and $\mathbb{K}$ be a [[field]]. The **strict category of $S$-graded vector spaces** $\cat{Gr}_{S}\Vect_{\mathbb{K}}$ is the [[category]] where an object is a [[graded vector space]] and a map is a [[Homomorphism of graded vector spaces#^graded]] $\mathbb{K}$-linear map. #m/def/linalg 
This is a [[Subcategory|wide subcategory]] of [[Closed category of graded vector spaces]].
