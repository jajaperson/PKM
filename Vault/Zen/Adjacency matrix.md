# Adjacency matrix

Let $\Gamma$ be a [[Graphs as quivers|graph-as-quiver]] with vertices $\Gamma(V)$ labelled $1,\dots,r$.
The **adjacency matrix** $A(\Gamma) = (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^r$ is an $r \times r$ matrix with entries
$$
\begin{align*}
a_{ij} = \abs{\Gamma(i,j)}
\end{align*}
$$
It is related to the [[Sum of neighbours operator]].
