# Determinant

The **determinant** $\det T$ of a [[linear endomorphism]] $T \in \End_{\mathbb{K}}V$ of a finite-dimensional vector space is the [[matrix determinant]] of its representation in any basis. #m/def/linalg
Equivalently, it is product of the [[Eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and eigenspaces|eigenvalues]] with multiplicity, which shows that the quantity is independent of choice of basis.
