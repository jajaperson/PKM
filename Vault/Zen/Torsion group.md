# Torsion elements and groups
A **torsion** $a \in G$ is a group element of finite order,
i.e. there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a^n = e$. #m/def/group 
A group containing only such elements is called a **torsion group**,
whereas a group whose only finite-order element is the identity is called **torsion-free**. #m/def/group 

In the case of abelian groups, these notions coincide with the more general [[Torsion]].

## Subgroups that are torsion groups
The following subgroups of abelian groups are torsion groups:

- The canonical [[Torsion subgroup of an abelian group]]
- [[Fixed order subgroup of an abelian group]]
- [[ùëù-torsion subgroup of an abelian group]]
