# Things as categories

Many objects of study in mathematics may alternately be viewed as a special kind of category.
Often this is related to [[oidification]] or [[Categorification]].

## Oidification

The following characterizes some structure as some single-object category,
hence involves [[oidification]].

- [[Monoids as categories]]
- [[Groups as categories]]

## Reframing

The following can be viewed as categories through a natural change in perspective.

- [[Preorders as categories]]
- [[Posets as categories]]

## Free categories

Some structures can be studied by constructing a related “free” category (see also [[Representation]])

- [[Free category]] (from a [[quiver]])
