# Conventions of $0$th-order logic in these notes

In these notes, we will use the following symbols for the propositional calculus.
Note some of these might not exist, depending on the logic used.

| Connective      | Symbol                |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| $p$ and $q$     | $p \land q$           |
| $p$ or $q$      | $p \lor q$            |
| not $p$         | $\neg p$              |
| $p$ implies $q$ | $p \Rightarrow q$     |
| $p$ iff $q$     | $p \Leftrightarrow q$ |
| tautology       | $\top$                |
| falsum          | $\bot$                |

We use square brackets $[-]$ as delimiters of propositions.
