# Centralizer in a group
The **centralizer** $C_{G}(a)$ of an element $a \in G$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $G$ containing all elements that commute with $a$,[^gallian] #m/def/group 
i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
C_{G}(a) = \{ b \in G \mid ab = ba \}
\end{align*}
$$
[^gallian]: 2017, [[@gallianContemporaryAbstractAlgebra2017|Contemporary Abstract Algebra]], p. 68

More generally, the **centralizer** $C_{G}(S)$ of any set $S \sube G$ contains elements which commute with the whole of $S$, i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
C_{G}(S) = \{ x \in G : (\forall s \in S)[xs = sx] \}
\end{align*}
$$

A related notion is the [[Centre of a group]] $Z(G) = C_{G}(G)$,
which includes only those elements that commute with all group elements.

## Additional properties

- Clearly the centraliser itself need not be abelian,
  since the centraliser of any $z \in Z(G)$ will be the entire group.
  For example, in the non-abelian group $D_{4}$, the centraliser $C(R_{180^ยบ}) = D_{4}$.
