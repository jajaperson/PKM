[[Graded algebra]]
# Category of graded algebras

Let $(\mathfrak{A}, +)$ be a [[monoid]] and $\mathbb{K}$ be a [[field]].
The **category of $\mathfrak{A}$-graded algebras** over $\mathbb{K}$ is a [[category]] where
an object is a $\mathfrak{A}$-[[graded algebra]]
and a morphism is a $\mathfrak{A}$-[[graded algebra homomorphism]]. #m/def/falg
