[[Axiomatic set theory]]
# Material set theory

A **material set theory** is a set theory based on a global membership relation $\in$
where sets are characterized by $\in$ and propositional equality.
These theories introduce a [[Cumulative hierarchy]].
[[F. William Lawvere]] describes such set theories as prioritizing [[Substance]] over [[Form]].


## Setup
Unless otherwise specified, we consider a universe $\mathcal{W}$ of objects with the following primitive notions[^2006]

- $x = y$ iff $x$ is the same object as $y$;
- $\shood(x)$ iff $x$ is a set;
- $x \in y$ iff $\shood(y)$ and $x$ is a member of $y$

where an object (not required to exist) in $\mathcal{W}$ that is not a set is called an [[Urelement]].
While most treatments do without urelements by considering only [[Pure set|pure sets]], these notes allow for their existence unless otherwise stated,
which occasionally complicates the statements of axioms somewhat.
