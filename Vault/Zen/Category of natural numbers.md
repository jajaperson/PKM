# Category of natural numbers

The **category of natural numbers** $\cat N$ is a [[small category]] such that $\Ob \cat N = \mathbb{N}_{0}$.
It is constructed as a [[skeleton category]] for [[Category of finite sets]] where for each $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ we take a representative $\mathbb{N}_{n} = \{i \}_{i=1}^n$.
This gives a kind of [[categorification]] of the [[Rig]] $\mathbb{N}_{0}$,
since the [[Products and coproducts|categorical product and coproduct]] correspond to multiplcication and addition respectively.
