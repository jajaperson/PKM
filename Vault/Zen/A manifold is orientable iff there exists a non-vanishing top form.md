# A $C^\alpha$-manifold is orientable iff there exists a non-vanishing top form

Let $(M, \mathscr{A})$ be an $n$-dimensional $C^\alpha$-[[Differentiable manifold|manifold]].
Then $M$ is [[Oriented manifold|oriented]] iff there exists a [[Differential form|top form]] $\dj V \in \Omega^n(M)$ which is everywhere nonvanishing. #m/thm/geo/diff
