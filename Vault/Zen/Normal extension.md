[[Field extension]]
# Normal extension

A [[field extension]] $L:K$ is **normal** iff every $f(x) \in K[x]$ with a root $\alpha \in L$ splits into linear factors in $L[x]$. #m/def/field
Equivalently, 

- Every embedding $L \hookrightarrow \overline{K}$ induces an [[Automorphism of a field extension|automorphism]] of $L:K$;
- $L$ is the [[Splitting field]] of a family of polynomials in $K[x]$.
