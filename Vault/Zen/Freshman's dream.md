[[Ring theory MOC]]
# Freshman's dream

The **Freshman's dream**
$$
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^p = x^p + y^p
\end{align*}
$$
does not holds in $\mathbb{Z}$, but is true in any [[commutative ring]] of prime [[characteristic]] $p$, #m/thm/ring
since applying the [[binomial expansion]]
$$
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^k y^{n-k}
\end{align*}
$$
and $p \mid {n \choose k}$ for $0 < k < n$.
