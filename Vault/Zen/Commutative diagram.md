# Commutative diagram

A **commutative diagram** is a directed graph with morphisms as edges and objects as vertices, such that any two paths sharing the same initial and final vertex are the same.[^br]
The diagram is thence said to **commute**.

## As a functor

A **diagram** of shape $\cat J$ in category $\cat C$ is a functor $\mathscr{D} : \cat J \to \cat C$,
where $\cat J$ is a usually [[Small category]] called the index category, #m/def/cat
and we typically use subscripts for objects.
A diagram is called **finite** iff the index category $\cat J$ is finite.

Related concepts are [[Cones and cocones]], and then [[Limits and colimits]].
