# PIE verb endings
PIE verb endings reflected person and number,
as well as voice, tense, and the imperative mood.
There appear to be two distinct systems, the latter being the rarer <em class="recon">h₂e</em>-paradigm.
Both paradigms distinguished between a set of **primary** and **secondary** endings[^ringe]

- In early PIE
  - **Primary** marked the nonpast of imperfective stems
  - **Secondary** marked the past of both perfective and imperfective stems
  - Some verbs used the <em class="recon">h₂e</em>-paradigm, undistinguished for primary and secondary.
- In Proto-Core IE
  - **Primary** endings marked the nonpast tense of imperfective stems and probably the subjunctive (except in the 1sg. of thematic aspect stems which used the <em class="recon">h₂e</em>-paradigm's <em class="recon">-o-h₂</em> instead of <em class="recon">-o-m-i</em>)
  - **Secondary** endings marked the optative mood and the past tense tense of both perfective and imperfective stems
  - <em class="recon">h₂e</em>-paradigm endings (undistinguished for primary and secondary) were used for the stative

## Cogwill's paradigm


- For the majority of the paradigm, the basic form is the secondary active,
  with the primary being derived using the so-called _hit-et-nunc_ particle <em class="recon">-i</em> (active 1sg., 2sg., 3sg., 3pl.).
- Some imperatives are derived using the particle <em class="recon">-u</em> (active 3sg., 3pl.).
- The active primary 1du. and 1pl. also appear to be derived from the secondary endings by an unknown process.
- The mediopassive originally used a different _hit-et-nunc_ particle <em class="recon">-r</em> (mediopassive 1sg., 2sg., 3sg., 3pl.), 
  however was supplanted by <em class="recon">-y</em> in [[A probable cladistic tree of IE|Central IE]] (perhaps taken from the active _hit-et-nunc_).
- The mediopassive dual and imperative endings are only attested in Greek and Indo-Iranian and they disagree.
- The underlyingly accented endings only surfaced as such when the stem bore no accent, i.e. leftmost accent surfaces (see [[PIE accent]]).

#### Active

|      | primary                             | secondary                             | imperative                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1sg. | <em class="recon">-m-i</em>         | <em class="recon">-m</em>             | —                                   |
| 2sg. | <em class="recon">-s-i</em>         | <em class="recon">-s</em>             | ∅, <em class="recon">-dʰí</em>[^em] |
| 3sg. | <em class="recon">-t-i</em>         | <em class="recon">-t</em>[^d]         | <em class="recon">-t-u</em>[^tow]   |
| 1du. | <em class="recon">-wós</em>         | <em class="recon">-wé</em>            | —                                   |
| 2du. | <em class="recon">-tés</em>         | <em class="recon">-tóm</em>           | <em class="recon">-tóm</em>         |
| 3du. | <em class="recon">-tés</em>         | <em class="recon">-tā́m</em>          | <em class="recon">-tā́m</em>        |
| 1pl. | <em class="recon">-mós</em>         | <em class="recon">-mé</em>            | —                                   |
| 2pl. | <em class="recon">-té</em>          | <em class="recon">-té</em>            | <em class="recon">-té</em>          |
| 3pl. | <em class="recon">-(é)nt-i</em>[^∅] | <em class="recon">-(é)nt</em>[^d][^∅] | <em class="recon">-(é)nt-u</em>[^∅] |

[^d]: Ending may have ben voiced due to [[PIE phonology MOC#Mostly productive|a phonological rule]].
[^tow]: This was possibly <em class="recon">-t-ow</em> (daughters disagree).
[^em]: Likely an emphatic ending added to ending less forms.
[^∅]: The active 3pl. followed aversion of the [[Ablaut|∅-grade]] rule: the full grade only surfaced for athematic, unaccented stems.
#### Mediopassive

|      | primary                                                             | secondary                                                       | imperative                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1sg. | <em class="recon">-h₂á-r</em>                                       | <em class="recon">-h₂á</em>                                     | —                              |
| 2sg. | <em class="recon">-th₂á-r</em>                                      | <em class="recon">-th₂á</em>                                    | ???                            |
| 3sg. | <em class="recon">-ó-r</em> or <em class="recon">-t-ó-r</em>[^cmp]  | <em class="recon">-ó</em> or <em class="recon">t-ó</em>[^cmp]   | ???                            |
| 1du. | <em class="recon">-wós-dʰh₂</em>                                    | <em class="recon">-wé-dʰh₂</em>                                 | —                              |
| 2du. | ???                                                                 | ???                                                             | ???                            |
| 3du. | ???                                                                 | ???                                                             | ???                            |
| 1pl. | <em class="recon">-mós-dʰh₂</em>                                    | <em class="recon">-mé-dʰh₂</em>                                 | —                              |
| 2pl  | <em class="recon">-dʰh₂ué</em>                                      | <em class="recon">-dʰh₂ué</em>                                  | <em class="recon">-dʰh₂ué</em> |
| 3pl. | <em class="recon">-ró-r</em> or <em class="recon">-ntó-r</em>[^cmp] | <em class="recon">-ró</em> or <em class="recon">-ntó</em>[^cmp] | ???                            |

[^cmp]: The former endings were in the process of being replaced by the latter as early as PIE. The consonants appear to be borrowed from active counterparts. The archaic version seems to have been retained for the optative 3pl.

## <em class="recon">h₂e</em>-paradigm
This paradigm did not distinguish primary/secondary, nor active/mediopassive.

| 3pl. | <em class="recon">-ḗr</em> < <em class="recon">-ḗrs</em> ~ <em class="recon">-ṛs</em> |

[^H]: <em class="recon">h₂e</em> 1du. and 1pl. may have been <em class="recon">-wéH</em> and <em class="recon">-méH</em> respectively.

## Non-finite forms

Core IE participles:

- Active participle with hysterokinetic <em class="recon">-(ó)nt-</em>
- Mediopassive participle with <em class="recon">-mh₁nó-</em> subject to [[PIE laryngeal deletion|laryngeal deletion]] and [[PIE syllabification of sonorants|syllabifaction]] of <span class="recon">/m/</span>.
- Nuclear IE stative participle with <em class="recon">-w(o)s-</em>
- Poorly attested Core IE aspect stem infinitive with <em class="recon">-dʰyo-</em>, probably only for imperfective stems.
  The infinitive is a noun derived from verb roots in most daughters.
