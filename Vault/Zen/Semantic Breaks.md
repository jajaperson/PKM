# Semantic Breaks

**Semantic breaks** (abbreviated **SemBr**) are a way of making editor-facing text more readable by breaking text into lines. 
It is intended to be used in contexts where markup line breaks are not shown in display output, such as Markdown, $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$, and HTML.

[Visit the SemBr website](https://sembr.org)

The SemBr variant I use in [[My style guide]] ignores the recommendation of limiting line length to 80 columns, 
since we have wrapping to deal with that.
This means that non-rendered line breaks have a purely semantic meaning,
allowing easier parsing of text while editing.

In my PKM, documents that follow this convention receive the #SemBr tag.


## SemBr 101
- Always follow sentences with a line break.
- In general break independent clauses, and dependent clauses where it makes sense.
- SemBr can also be useful for splitting multilingual writing â€”
	Obsidian's spell checker will recognise a change in language if it takes place on a new line.

## Using in Obsidian
To use SemBr in Obsidian, it is necessary to enable the `Strict line breaks` option in Editor settings.
