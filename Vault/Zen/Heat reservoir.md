# Heat reservoir
A **heat reservoir** or **heat bath** is an idealized body 
which can absorb or lose an arbitrary amount of heat without changing its temperature.
Often it is also assumed to have a small relaxation time so that heat transfer can occur [[Quasistatic process|quasistatically]].
In practice, we approximate it with a substance of very high [[The relationship between temperature and heat in a solid or liquid|specific heat]].
