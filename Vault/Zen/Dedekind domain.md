# Dedekind domain

A **Dedekind domain** $R$ is an [[integral domain]] such that #m/def/ring 

1. $R$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]];
2. $R$ is [[Integrally closed domain|integrally closed]];
3. $R$ has [[Krull dimension]] $1$, i.e. every nontrivial [[prime ideal]] is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]], and there exists a nontrivial prime ideal.

## Equivalent characterizations

- [[An integral domain admits UFI iff it is Dedekind]]
- [[An integral domain is Dedekind iff every nonzero fractional ideal is invertible]]

## Properties


- [[Ring of integers of a number field]]
- [[Prime ideals are invertible in a Dedekind domain]]
- [[Fractional ideals of a Dedekind domain form an abelian group]]
