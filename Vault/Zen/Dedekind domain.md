# Dedekind domain

A **Dedekind domain** $R$ is an [[integral domain]] such that #m/def/ring 

1. $R$ is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]];
2. $R$ is [[Integrally closed domain|integrally closed]];
3. $R$ has [[Krull dimension]] $1$, i.e. every nontrivial [[prime ideal]] is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].

## Properties

- [[Unique factorization of ideals in a Dedekind domain]]
- [[The ring of integers of a number field is a Dedekind domain]]
