[[Unital associative algebra]]
# Clifford algebra

Let $(V, Q)$ be a [[quadratic space]] over $\mathbb{K}$. 
The **Clifford algebra** $\opn{Cl}(V,Q)$ is the freÃ«st [[unital associative algebra]] generated by $V$ subject to the condition to
$$
\begin{align*}
v^2 = Q(v)1
\end{align*}
$$
as formalized by the [[#universal property]].

## Construction

The Clifford algebra may be constructed as a [[quotient algebra]] of the [[tensor algebra]]

$$
\begin{align*}
\opn{Cl}(V,Q) = \frac{T^\bullet V}{\langle v \otimes v - Q(v) : v \in V \rangle_{\trianglelefteq T^\bullet V} }
\end{align*}
$$
where the divisor is the [[algebra ideal]] generated by tensors of the form $v \otimes v - Q(v)1$.

## Relation to the exterior algebra

The [[exterior algebra]] is the [[associated graded algebra]] of the Clifford algebra, whence there is a [[Natural linear isomorphism between filtered algebra and associated graded algebra|natural linear isomorphism]] between them.
With this identification, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\bigwedge_{j=1}^k v_{j} = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{k}} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{j=1}^k v_{j}
\end{align*}
$$
We carry over all the terminology, referring to $k$-vectors, &c.
