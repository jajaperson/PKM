# Simple object

Let $\cat C$ be a [[category]].
An object $X \in \cat C$ is called **simple** iff its only quotients (in the sense of [[Equalizer and coëqualizer|coëqualizers]]) are the [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] and $X$ itself.[^1] #m/def/cat
If $\cat C$ is [[Abelian category|abelian category]],
it is sufficient for $X$ to have no [[subobject|subobjects]].

## Examples

- [[Simple group]] in [[Category of groups]].
- [[Simple module]] in [[Category of left modules]].
- [[Simple ring]] in [[Category of rings]].

## Properties

- [[Schur's lemma#Schur's lemma in abelian categories]]

[^1]: Constructively, a quotient $Y$ of $X$ is $X$ iff it is not $\mathbb{1}$.
