[[PIE phonology MOC]]
# PIE \*/s/ insertion
It appears that coronal geminates were not allowed, except in the cases of nursery-words.
Would-be cross-morphological coronal geminates were avoided in PIE via the insertion of an <em class='recon'>/s/</em>,
so <em class='recon'>/TT/</em> → <em class='recon'>/TsT/</em>.
These clusters were simplified in non-Anatolian daughter languages.

In efforts to explain the [[Thorn cluster]], it has been suggested that <em class='recon'>/s/</em> insertion extended to any <em class='recon'>/TC/</em> sequence,
so <em class='recon'>TC</em> → <em class='recon'>TsC</em>.
