[[Material set theory]]
# Axiom of Purity

The **Axiom of Purity** is a possible axiom of [[material set theory]] included in most axiomatizations of [[ZF]]: #m/def/set
$$
\begin{align*}
(\forall x)[\shood(x)]
\end{align*}
$$
which is to say, the domain of discourse is restricted to sets,
and thus every set is a [[pure set]] and there are no [[Urelement|urelements]].
These notes will not assume purity unless otherwise stated.
