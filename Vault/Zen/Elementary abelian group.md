# Elementary abelian group

An **elementary abelian group** is an [[abelian group]] in which the [[group order|order]] of every non-identity element is the same. #m/def/group 
Since this must must be a prime number $p$, it follows that every elementary abelian group is a [[p-group]],
and such groups may be considered a [[vector space]] over [[Modular arithmetic|$\mathbb Z_p$]].
