[[Poset]]
# Complete lattice

A **complete lattice** is a [[poset]] for which the least upper bound or join and the greatest upper bound or meet exists for any arbitrary collection of elements, #m/def/order 
whereas for a [[Lattice order]] these need only exist for pairs of elements.
Viewed as a [[Posetal category]], all [[Products and coproducts]] exist.
