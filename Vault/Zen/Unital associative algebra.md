[[Algebra over a field]]
# Unital associative algebra

A **unital associative algebra** $A$ is an [[algebra over a field]] $\mathbb{K}$ for which the bilinear product possesses a two-sided identity $1$ and is associative. #m/def/falg 
- $1 a = a 1 = a$ for all $a \in A$
- $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all $a,b,c \in A$

In other words, an associative algebra is a field action on a [[ring]].
An algebra homomorphism which preserves the identity is a [[unital associative algebra homomorphism]].

## Further terminology

 - [[Algebraic element]]

## Examples

- [[Matrix algebra]]
- [[Complex number]]
- [[Quaternion]] (non-commutative)
- [[Endomorphism ring]]
- [[Tensor algebra]]
- [[Clifford algebra]]
- [[Extension field as a unital associative algebra]]
