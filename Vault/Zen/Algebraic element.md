[[Unital associative algebra]]
# Algebraic element

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a [[field]] and $A$ be a [[unital associative algebra]] (or [[extension field]], see [[extension field as a unital associative algebra]]) over $\mathbb{K}$.
An element $a \in A$ is called **algebraic** over $\mathbb{K}$ iff there exists a nonzero polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}[x]$ such that $p(a) = 0$. #m/def/falg 
An element which is not algebraic is called **transcendental** over $\mathbb{K}$.
If $a$ is algebraic,
the solving [[Polynomial ring#^monic]] of smallest degree $m_{a}(x) \in \mathbb{K}[x]$ is called the **minimal polynomial** of $a$.

## Examples

- [[All elements of a finite-dimensional unital associative algebra are algebraic]]

## Properties

- [[Subalgebra generated by an algebraic element]]
- [[An algebraic element is invertible iff its minimal polynomial has a nonzero constant term]]
- [[Roots of a minimal polynomial]]
- [[Spectrum of an algebraic element]]
