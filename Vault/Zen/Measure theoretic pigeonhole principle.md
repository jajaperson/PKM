[[Pigeonhole principle]]
# Measure theoretic pigeonhole principle

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[measure space|measure spaces]] and $f : X \to Y$ be a [[measurable function]].
We call $f$ **finitely piecewise measure-preserving** iff there exists a partition $\{ X_{i} \}_{i=1}^n$ into measurable sets such that
$$
\begin{align*}
\mu(f(X_{i})) = \mu(X_{i})
\end{align*}
$$
for all $i \in \mathbb{N}_{n}$.
Given such a function, if $\mu(X) > \mu(f(X))$, then $f$ is not [[Surjectivity, injectivity, and bijectivity|injective]].[^2022] #m/thm/measure
