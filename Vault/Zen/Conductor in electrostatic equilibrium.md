# Conductors in equilibrium

A **conductor in electrostatic equilibrium** is a conductor 
in which there is no net motion of charge (i.e. static).
Conductors in equilibrium have the properties

1. $\vab E = \vab 0$ everywhere inside the conductor,
   since if it wasn't internal electrons would be moving due to a force. ^P1
2. All charge resides on the surface of the conductor.
   This follows from [[#^P1]] and [[Gau√ü's law]]. ^P2
3. The electric field at the surface is normal to the surface.
   If this were not the case, electrons would move across the surface. ^P3
4. It follows the [[electrostatic potential]] is constant inside the conductor and on its surface.
