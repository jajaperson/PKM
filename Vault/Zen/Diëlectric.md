# Diëlectric

A **diëlectric** or **insulator** is a material with no mobile charge inside which cannot support a continuous electric current.
Thus all charge is bound to atoms or molecules, however the charge distribution may still be slightly modified by the application of an electric field,
by either

- inducing dipoles
- aligning permanent dipoles

See [[Electric potential of a polarized material]].
A diëlectric obeying a linear polarization law is termed a [[Linear diëlectric]].
