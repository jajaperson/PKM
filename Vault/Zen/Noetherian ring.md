# Noetherian ring

A ring $R$ is called (left/right) **Noetherian** iff any of the following equivalent conditions hold:[^2022] #m/def/ring 

1. (left/right) [[ideal]] $I \trianglelefteq R$ is [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as a (left/right) $R$-module; 
2. every increasing sequence $I_{1} \trianglelefteq I_{2} \trianglelefteq \cdots$ of (left/right) ideals of $R$ has a largest element;
3. every non-empty set of (left/right) ideals of $R$ contains a maximal element.
