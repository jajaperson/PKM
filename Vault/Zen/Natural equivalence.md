[[Natural transformation]]
# Natural equivalence

A **natural equivalence** or **natural isomorphism** is an isomorphism in a [[functor category]], #m/def/cat 
i.e. a [[natural transformation]] $\eta \in \cat D^{\cat C}(F, G)$
such that $\eta_{X} : FX \to GX$ is an [[Morphism|isomorphism]] for all $X \in \cat C$.

The idea was first proposed in [[@eilenbergGeneralTheoryNatural1945|A general theory of natural equivalences]], which is also the originating paper of category theory.
