# Group commutator

The **commutator** $[a,b]$ of two group members $a,b \in G$ is a way of describing how far two elements are from commuting with each other.
For any $a,b \in G$ the commutator is defined as #m/def/group 
$$
\begin{align*}
[a,b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$
Thus $a$ and $b$ commute iff $[a,b] = e$.
The commutators of all elements forms a normal subgroup called the [[Commutator subgroup]].

## Properties

- $[b,a] = [a,b]^{-1}$
