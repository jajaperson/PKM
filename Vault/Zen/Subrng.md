# Subrng

A **subrng** is a subset of a [[rng]] $S \sube R$ such that $S$ is a ring under the same operations, #m/def/ring
i.e. $S$ forms both a [[subgroup]] under addition and subsemigroup under multiplication of $R$.

## Subrng test

**Theorem.** Iff $a-b$ and $ab$ are in $S$ whenever $a,b \in S$, then $S$ is a subring of $R$. #m/thm/ring

> [!check]- Proof
> The [[Subgroup#One step subgroup test]] tests for the additive subgroup, whereas closure is necessary and sufficient for multiplication.
