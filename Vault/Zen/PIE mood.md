# PIE verb mood
The [[grammatical mood]] system of [[#early PIE]] was very simple consisting of only two moods,
though it was eventually extended into a more complex system in the descendent [[#Nuclear IE]] branch.[^2017]

[^2017]: 2017\. [[Sources/@ringeProtoIndoEuropeanProtoGermanic2017|From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic]], p. 28

## Early PIE
Originally PIE only has two reconstructable moods:

- **Indicative** with **past** and **present** tense —
  Used for statements.
- **Imperative** unmarked for tense — 
  Used for commands.

These were distinguished by polyfunctional [[PIE verb endings|verb endings]].
It is unclear whether additional moods (see [[#Nuclear IE|below]]) should be reconstructed for PIE 
since no reflexes have been proven in the Anatolian system.

## Nuclear IE
[[A probable cladistic tree of IE|Nuclear IE]] saw the appearance of two additional moods,
such that the complete paradigm was as follows:

- **Indicative** with **past** and **present** tense —
  Used for statements.
- **Imperative** unmarked for tense — 
  Used for commands.
- **Subjunctive** unmarked for tense —
  Used to express events as not fully realised, including future events.
- **Optative** unmarked for tense —
  Used to express wishes or desires.

Indicative and imperative continued to be marked by [[PIE verb endings]],
while subjunctive and optative were inflected within the [[PIE verb stem formation#mood|stem]].
