[[Group representation theory MOC]]
# Maschke's theorem

Every [[unitary representation]] is the [[Direct sum of representations|direct sum]] of unitary [[Irrep|irreps]],
and thus any [[representation of a compact group]] is the direct sum of unitary irreps. #m/thm/rep 

> [!check]- Proof
> Follows from the fact that [[The orthogonal compliment of an invariant subspace under a unitary operator is invariant]] and [[Every representation of a compact group is equivalent to a unitary representation]].
> <span class="QED"/>

This core statement of group representation theory allows for the [[Decomposition of a representation]], 
and therefore reduces the task of classifying representations to classifying finite ones.
