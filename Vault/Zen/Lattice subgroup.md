# Lattice subgroup

A **lattice** $L$ of a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]] $G$ is a [[discrete subgroup]] $L \leq G$ such that the quotient $G / L$ is [[Compact space|compact]]. #m/def/group
The above definition generalizes and is motivated by the case where $G = \mathbb{Q}^n$, where we define a [[Rational lattice]].

## In a vector space

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional space vector space over $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$.
Let $L \leq V$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[submodule]] spanning $V$. The following are equivalent #m/thm/topology 

1. $L$ is a lattice subgroup of $V$;
2. $L$ is generated by $n$ elements;
3. $L \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ in $\lMod{\mathbb{Z}}$.
