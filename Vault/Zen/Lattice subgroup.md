# Lattice subgroup

A **lattice** $L$ of a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]] $G$ is a [[discrete subgroup]] $L \leq G$ such that the quotient $G / L$ is [[Compact space|compact]]. #m/def/group
The above definition generalizes and is motivated by the case where $G = \mathbb{Q}^n$, which is a [[Rational lattice]].
