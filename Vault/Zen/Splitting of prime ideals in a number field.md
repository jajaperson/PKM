# Splitting of prime ideals

Suppose $L : K$ is an [[field extension|extension]] of [[Number field|number fields]] and $\mathfrak{p} \trianglelefteq \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a [[prime ideal]] of the [[Ring of integers of a number field|ring of integers]].
Then by [[Unique factorization of ideals|UFI]], $\mathfrak{p}\mathcal{O}_{L}$ has a unique factorization into prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_{j} \trianglelefteq \mathcal{O}_{L}$
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{p} \mathcal{O}_{L} = \prod_{j=1}^g \mathfrak{p}_{j}^{e_{j}}
\end{align*}
$$
where the multiplicities $e_{j}$ are called **ramification indices**. #m/def/num/alg 
Moreover,

- if $\mathfrak{p} \mathcal{O}_{L}$ is a prime ideal, then $L:K$ is **inert** at $\mathfrak{p}$;
- if $e_{j} > 1$ for some $j$, then $L:K$ is **ramified** at $\mathfrak{p}$;
- otherwise $L:K$ is **unramified** at $\mathfrak{p}$.
