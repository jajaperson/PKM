# Finitely generated module

An $R$-[[module]] $M$ is said to be **finitely generated** iff it has a finite [[Span|spanning set]] $\{ m_{i} \}_{i=1}^r$ #m/def/module 
so that
$$
\begin{align*}
M = \Span_{R} \{ m_{i} \}_{i=1}^r
\end{align*}
$$
Thus a [[vector space]] is finitely generate iff it is finite dimensional, however the situation is more complicated over a general ring.

## Properties

1. [[Finitely generated module over a finite R-ring]]
