[[First countability axiom]]
# Limit points are limits of convergent subsequences in a first-countable space

Let $X$ be a [[First countability axiom|first-countable]] topological space and $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty \in X$ be a sequence.
Then $a \in X$ is a [[Limit point]] of $x_{n}$ iff there exists a [[Convergence|convergent]] [[subsequence]] $(x_{n_{i}})_{i=1}^\infty \to a$. #m/thm/topology
