[[Group action]]
# $n$-orbit

An $n$-orbit is a generalization of the [[Group action orbital]].
Given a [[group action]] of $G$ on $\Omega$, there is a natural group action of $G$ on $\Omega^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
and the [[Group action orbit|orbits]] under this induced action are called **$n$-orbits**. #m/def/group
