# Atlas

An **atlas** is a set of [[Co√∂rdinate chart|charts]] whose codomains form an [[Cover set|open cover]]. #m/def/geo 
Typically this is given as an indexed family of pairs $\{(U_{i}, \varphi_{i}) \}_{i \in I}$ where $\varphi_{i} : U_{i} \to \varphi_{i}(U_{i}) \sube \mathbb{R}^n$ are the chart homeomorphisms.
