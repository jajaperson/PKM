[[Group character]]
# Centre of a character

Let $\mathfrak{X} : G \to \Vect_{(\mathbb{C})}$ be a finite-degree representation affording [[Group character|character]] $\chi$.
Then 
$$
\begin{align*}
\abs{\chi(g)} = \chi (1) \iff \mathfrak{X}(g) = \lambda 1
\end{align*} 
$$
for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. #m/thm/rep
