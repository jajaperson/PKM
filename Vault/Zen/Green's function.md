# Green's function

Let $L$ be some translation-invariant linear [[differential operator]].
A **Green's function** $G$ is a solution to the differential equation[^phys] #m/def/anal/fun 
$$
\begin{align*}
LG = \delta
\end{align*}
$$
where $\delta$ is the [[Dirac delta]] â€”
hence it may be thought of as the **convolution kernel** of $L$.
Green's functions can be used to solve inhomogenous differential equations by [[Convolution]] of the source function.
Specifically, the differential equation $Lf = \rho$ is solved by $f = G * \rho + f_{H}$ (plus a homogenous solution),
which can be made unique after applying boundary conditions.

If $L$ is not translation-invariant, then one replaces $G(x-x')$ with $G(x,x')$.

[^phys]: In physics there is a convention to write $LG = -\delta$.

## Properties

1. If $G$ is a Green's function and $Lg = 0$ then $G + g$ is a Green's function.

## Examples

- [[Heaviside function]] (Green's function for $D$)
- [[Green's function for the Laplacian]]
