# Riemannian volume form

Let $M$ be an [[Oriented manifold|oriented]] $n$-dimensional [[semi-Riemannian manifold]] with metric tensor $g$.
The **Riemannian volume form** $\dj V \in \Omega^n(M)$ is a canonical [[Differential form|top form]]
$$
\begin{align*}
\dj V = \mathrm{vol}_{n} = \star(1)
\end{align*}
$$
which given a [[CoÃ¶rdinate chart|chart]] $x : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as
$$
\begin{align*}
\dj V =  \sqrt{ \abs g } \, \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n
\end{align*}
$$
where $\abs g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor.

> [!missing]- Proof this is well-defined
> #missing/proof
> It suffices to show that $\dj V$ abides the [[Tensor field transformation laws]].
