[[Topological degree]]
# Degree of a circle endomorphism

Let $f: \mathbb{S}^1 \to \mathbb{S}^1$ be continuous.
Then there is a unique continuous $\varphi : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with the property $\varphi(0) = 0$ and $f \ex = f(1) \cdot \ex \varphi$, #m/thm/homotopy 
so the following diagram commutes[^loose]

Then the degree $\deg f$ of $f$ is given by
$$
\begin{align*}
\deg f = \varphi(1)
\end{align*}
$$
which is always a whole number.

## Generalisation to closed path

If $\alpha : \mathbb{S}^1 \to \mathbb{C}$ is a closed continuous path,
then we may define the winding number of $\alpha$ around $z$ as
$$
\begin{align*}
n(\alpha; z) = \deg f_{\alpha, z}
\end{align*}
$$
where $f_{\alpha, z} : \mathbb{S}^1 \to \mathbb{S}^1$
$$
\begin{align*}
f_{\alpha,z}(\zeta) = \frac{\alpha(\zeta) - z}{\abs{\alpha(\zeta) - z}}
\end{align*}
$$

## Ring isomorphism

$\hTop(\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{S}^1)$ is a [[ring]] with function multiplication as addition and composition as multiplication.
Then $\deg : (\hTop(\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{S}^1), \cdot, \circ) \to (\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot)$ is a ring isomorphism, since [[Circle endomorphisms are homotopic iff they are of equal degree]] and $\deg z^n = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$,

## Examples

- $\deg cT$ for any [[Constant map]]
- $\deg \id = 1$
- $\deg z^n = n$

## Properties

- [[Circle endomorphisms are homotopic iff they are of equal degree]]
