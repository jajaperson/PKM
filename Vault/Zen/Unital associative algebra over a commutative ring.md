[[Algebra over a commutative ring]]
# $R$-ring

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]].
An **$R$-ring** $T$ is a [[Monoid object|monoid]] in the category [[Category of modules over a commutative ring|$R$-ring]].
More concretely, an **$R$-ring** $T$ can be viewed in two equivalent ways: #m/def/calg

1. As an $R$-[[Algebra over a commutative ring|algebra]] $T$ which is unital and associative;
2. As a [[ring]] $T$ equipped with a homomorphism $R \to \opn Z(T)$ into its [[Centre of a rng|centre]].

This is of course a strenthening of [[Associative algebra over a commutative ring|$R$-rng]].
It follows every [[ring]] is a [[Integers]]-ring in a unique way.
