[[Unital associative algebra over a field]]
# Division algebra

A **division algebra** $(A, \cdot)$ is at once a [[Unital associative algebra over a field]] and a [[division ring]], #m/def/falg 
hence for every nonzero $a \in A$ there exists some (necessarily unique) $a^{-1} \in A$ such that $a^{-1}a = aa^{-1} = 1_{A}$.

## Properties

- [[Division algebra with only algebraic elements over an algebraically closed field]]
