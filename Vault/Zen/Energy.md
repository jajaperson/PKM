# Energy
Energy ($E: \pu{J}$) is the ability to do [[Work]]. 
In general, energy is either kinetic or potential.
Kinetic energy comes in the form of [[Translational kinetic energy]]
and [[Rotational kinetic energy]].
Potential energy comes in the form of elastic, chemical, nuclear, gravitational, &c. energy.

In [[Newtonian mechanics MOC|Mechanics]] we say energy can be dissipated, 
which relates to [[Entropy]] and the [[Second law of thermodynamics]].
