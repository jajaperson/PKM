[[Things as categories]]
# Posets as categories

A [[poset]] may be viewed as a [[Posetal category]] (with $a \to b$ denoting $a \leq b$) and vice versa, where

- reflexivity and transitivity are equivalent to identity and composition in the definition of a category, but since we have at most one way of relating $a$ to $b$ this is a [[Thin category]].
- antisymmetry is equivalent to the condition of being [[Skeletal category]].

In addition

- A [[monotone mapping]] is a [[functor]] of posets-as-categories
- A [[totally ordered set]] is a [[connex category]]
- The [[Poset#^sup]] is the [[Products and coproducts|coproduct]]
- The [[Poset#^inf]] is the [[Products and coproducts|categorical product]]
