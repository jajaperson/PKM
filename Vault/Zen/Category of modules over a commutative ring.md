[[Category of left-modules]]
# Category of modules over a commutative ring

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]].
Then [[Category of left-modules]] is a [[monoidal category]] under the normal [[Tensor product of modules over a commutative ring|tensor product]] with $R$ regarded as an $R$-module as its tensor unit. #m/thm/module 
See also the special case of [[Category of vector spaces]].
