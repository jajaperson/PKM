# Incidence geometry

An **incidence geometry** is the simplest kind of geometry,
consisting of a triple $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{E},I)$ where the set of points $\mathcal{P}$ and the set of lines $\mathcal{E}$ are two disjoint nonempty sets and $I \sube \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{E}$ is an [[Incidence relation]].[^2020] #m/def/geo
