# $p$-group

Given a [[prime number]] $p$, a **$p$-group** $G$ is a [[group]] in which the [[group order|order]] of every element is an $\mathbb{N}_{0}$ power of $p$, #m/def/group i.e. for all $x \in G$
$$
\begin{align*}
\abs x= p^n
\end{align*}
$$
for some $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$.
For a [[finite group]] this is equivalent to the [[group order|order]] of $G$ being an $\mathbb{N}_{0}$ power of $p$, i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
\abs G = p^n
\end{align*}
$$
for some $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$.
