# Cyclotomic field

A **cyclotomic field** $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta_{n}]$ is a [[number field]] obtained by [[Adjunction of a ring|adjoining]] a primitive $n$th root of unity, #m/def/num/alg
i.e. $\zeta_{n} = \mathrm{e}^{2\pi i / n}$.
Its [[Algebraic integer|ring of integers]] are the [[Cyclotomic integers]] $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_{n}]$.
