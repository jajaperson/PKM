# Sheet number of a connected covering

Let $p : (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_{0}) \twoheadrightarrow (X,x_{0})$ be a connected covering.
Then the **sheet number**, i.e. the number of fibres $\abs{p^{-1}\{ x \}}$, is given by the [[Lagrange's theorem|subgroup index]] of the [[Characteristic subgroup of a covering|characteristic subgroup]] of $p$ in the [[fundamental group]][^loose] #m/thm/homotopy 
$$
\begin{align*}
|p^{-1}\{ x \}| = [\pi_{1}(X,x_{0}) : \pi_{1}p(\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{x}_{0}))]
\end{align*}
$$
