[[PIE syllabification of sonorants]]
# Lindeman's option
**Lindeman's option** (an extension of **Edgerton's option**) attempts to explain the seemingly randomly alternating sonorant syllabification in cognates with word-initial <em class="recon">CR</em>.
For example, reflexes reflect both PIE <em class="recon">dyḗm</em> and <em class="recon">diḗm</em> (sky/day) are reflected in daughter languages,
notably Sanskrit contains reflexes of both versions (<em class="ling">dyā́m</em>, <em class="ling">diā́m</em>).

Edgerton's explanation was that [[Siever's law]] was in fact taking place across word boundaries,
so that the form <em class="recon">dyḗm</em> could only occur utterance-initially or after a word ending in a [[Heavy syllable|light syllable]],
whereas <em class="recon">diḗm</em> would occur in other cases.
Lindeman's argued that this phenomenon can only be observed in monosyllabic words,
so the formulation is

> **Lindeman's option** :: A monosyllabic word beginning with a <em class="recon">CR</em> cluster will alternate to <em class="recon">CṚ</em> if the previous word ends in a heavy syllable.

However, other explanations for the phenomenon are possible, 
for example it may be that ==Edgerton's option held generally but syllabified alternants were simply retained more strongly for monosyllabics in daughter languages.==
