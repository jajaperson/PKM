# External Axiom of Choice

A category $\cat C$ is said to satisfy the **external Axiom of Choice** iff every [[epimorphism]] [[Split epimorphism|splits]], #m/def/cat 
i.e. has a [[Split epimorphism|section]] (pre√Ønverse).
The name comes from the fact that the traditional [[Axiom of Choice]] is just the statement that [[Category of sets]] has this property.
