# Macroscopic state variables of an ideal gas
The macroscopic state of a gas in thermal equilibrium is fully encoded by its
[[Temperature]], [[Pressure]], and Volume. 
These are known as the **state parameters** or **thermodynamic variables**.
$$
\begin{align*}
\ket{g} = \vthree{p}{V}{T}
\end{align*}
$$
Typically the units used are

- $T: \pu{K}$ for temperature
- $p: \pu{Pa = N.m-2}$ for pressure
- $V: \pu{m3}$ for volume

These quantities, together with the number of moles of gas particles,
are related by the [[Ideal gas law]].
