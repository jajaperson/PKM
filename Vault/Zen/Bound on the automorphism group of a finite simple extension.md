[[Simple extension]]
# Bound on the automorphism group of a finite simple or separable extension

Suppose $L:K$ is a [[finite field extension]] which is [[Simple extension|simple]] (or [[Separable extension|separable]], which amounts to the same thing).
Then $\abs{\Aut(L:K)}$ is the number of distinct roots of the [[Algebraic element|minimal polynomial]] $m_{\vartheta}(x) \in K[x]$, #m/thm/field
in particular
$$
\begin{align*}
\abs{\Aut(L:K)} \leq [L:K]
\end{align*}
$$
with equality iff $L:K$ is [[Separable extension|separable]] and [[Normal extension|normal]], i.e. [[Galois extension|Galois]].[^2009]

As a corollary, automorphisms act [[Effective group action|faithfully]] and [[Transitive group action|transitively]] on the roots of $m_{\vartheta}(x)$.
