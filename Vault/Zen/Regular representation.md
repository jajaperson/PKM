[[Module over a unital associative algebra]]
# Regular representation

The **regular representation** $\Lambda : A \to \End(A)$ of an [[Unital associative algebra]] $A$ is a natural [[Representation]] of $A$ carried by itself, where
$$
\begin{align*}
\Lambda(a)b = a b
\end{align*}
$$
Thus every [[Unital associative algebra]] is a [[Module over a unital associative algebra|module]] over itself.
