[[Ring theory MOC]]
# Ideal

A [[subrng]] $A \leq R$ is called a **left-ideal** iff $RA \sube A$,
a **right-ideal** iff $AR \sube A$,
and a **two-sided ideal** (sometimes just **ideal**) iff both conditions hold. #m/def/ring 
This property is sometimes called absorption.
Similarly to a [[normal subgroup]] in group theory,
an ideal can be used to construct a [[Quotient ring]].

See [[algebra ideal]] for the similar concept for an algebra over a field.
Ideals began with Albert Kummer's [[Ideal number]], which Dedekind realized could be captured using the ideal-as-a-set formulation.
