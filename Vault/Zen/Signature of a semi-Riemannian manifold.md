[[Semi-Riemannian manifold]]
# Signature of a semi-Riemannian manifold

Let $(M, \mathscr{A}, g)$ be a [[Semi-Riemannian manifold]]. 
At any point, $g_{ab}$ is congruent to a matrix of the form
$$
\begin{align*}
\diag(\underbrace{ 1,\dots,1 }_{ s },\underbrace{ -1,\dots,-1 }_{ t })
\end{align*}
$$
where by [[Sylvester's law of inertia]] the quantity $(s,t)$ is uniquely determined continuous function of points on the manifold.
Thus if $M$ is [[Connectedness|connected]], we have a uniquely determined **signature** $(s,t)$ for the entire manifold. #m/def/geo/diff
