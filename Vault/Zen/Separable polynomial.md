# Separable polynomial

Let $K$ be a [[field]].
A [[Polynomial ring|polynomial]] $f(x) \in K[x]$ is **separable** iff all its roots have multiplicity 1 in $\overline{K}[x]$,
where $\overline{K}$ is the [[Algebraic closure]]. #m/def/field
Equivalently,
$$
\begin{align*}
\gcd\left( f(x) , \frac{d}{dx} f(x) \right) = 1
\end{align*}
$$
