# Hask
The Category of Haskell Types, called $\Hask$, is a category with [[Haskell type]] for objects and functions for morphisms. 
It behaves very similarly to [[Category of sets]].

Due to a few minor issues, $\Hask$ is not formally a category. 
However in the majority of cases it makes sense and is useful to use categorical reasoning.
