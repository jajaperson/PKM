[[Representation theory MOC]]
# Representation

A (linear) **representation** of an [[Abstract algebra MOC|algebraic structure]] $A$ is a [[Morphism|homomorphism]] from $A$ to an algebraic structure of the same kind on a set of [[linear map|linear maps]], #m/def/rep 
which for single-typed structures is typically a subset of $\End V$ for some [[vector space]] $V$ called the **carrier space**.
A representation may thus be considered a [[functor]].

> [!info]+ Relation to modules
> If the represented structure is an [[Unital associative algebra]],
> a representation is equivalent to a [[Module over a unital associative algebra]],
> and indeed in most cases one can move from representations of an algebraic structure to representations of a related associative algebra (e.g. [[group ring]], [[Universal enveloping algebra]]) over a field without loss of information.
> This is because $\End V$ itself is an [[Endomorphism ring]].
