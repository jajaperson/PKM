  abstract = {The emergence of the obligation to preserve the environment has affected the consumption model; therefore, green products and sustainable consumption have become an international concern. All over the world, green consumption is being considered, as consumers are essential contributors to the achievement of sustainable development goals, owing to their ability to choose between ungreen and eco-friendly products and services. However, very few studies have examined the trend in consumer's preferences and behavior in relation to sustainable development, especially in developing countries. This study analyzes the impact of consumers' environmental ethics, green consumerism, moral obligation, green attitude, on consumers' willingness to consume green products and actual green consumption, with the mediating role of willingness to consume green products. Using survey questionnaire, data were collected via face-to-face interaction and were analysed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The study found that consumers' environmental ethics, moral obligation, and green attitude have a significant influence on consumers' willingness to consume green products, which eventually impacts consumers’ actual green consumption. Similarly, the study established the indirect mediating role of consumers’ willingness to consume green products on the relationship between consumers’ environmental ethics, moral obligation, and green attitude, as well as green consumption. This study further contributes to the existing literature by disproving the possible influence of income groups on the relationship between consumers’ willingness to consume green products and actual green consumption. Thus, this study provides new insights for policymakers towards formulating favorable policies to increase consumers' green consumption and sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how consumers in emerging market respond to sustainable development goals initiatives by marketers and firms. The study seeks to identify how sustainable marketing strategies contribute to attaining the SDGs in Ghana, a developing and emerging country in sub-Saharan Africa. Design/methodology/approach A positivist methodological framework was used for the collection of data, analysis and theoretical development in this research. A total of 780 questionnaires were handed out. Out of this number, a total of 650 were returned. However, due to missing values, 622 valid responses were used for analysis. Of the valid responses, 306 (about 49.23\%) were males while 316 were females, representing about 50.8\%. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse data and investigate the relationship amongst advertising, packaging, pricing, green marketing strategies and purchasing behaviour. Findings Study findings provide insight into how marketing strategies affect consumer purchasing decisions and brand loyalty. Findings revealed positive relationship between green marketing and purchase behaviour. Empirical results from this study also confirm the mediating role of price on the relationship between green marketing strategies and purchase behaviour. Research limitations/implications While this study is limited to a single country Ghana, the findings can have far-reaching implications for many countries in the emerging markets sector. The study provides a vivid illustration of how environmental concerns can affect consumers' attitude towards products or services. Practical implications Policy on environmental issues can be developed from this study. Marketers can be more effective at how to effect consumer behaviour using findings from this research. Social implications Firms employing green marketing strategies must be aware of the importance the youth places on sustainability and develop strategies that enhance social acceptance by the youth. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, sustainable and environmental issues have been researched on, but pricing and advertising have not been used as a mediating variable on purchasing behaviour in Ghana. Moreover investigation of green marketing strategies and purchase behaviour, advertising packaging and brand loyalty using structural equation modelling analysis within the Ghanaian public space is unique.},

  abstract = {Consumer awareness about organic foods has been growing. However, this trend is not always translated to consumer organic food purchases. It is argued that when it comes to assessing organics, one should expect consumers to use multiattribute evaluations due to credence attributes and organic standards that organic foods need to adhere to. A thorough review of the existing literature on consumer buying behavior of organic foods identifies healthism, hedonism, and trust among some factors that enhance consumer experiences with organic foods and therefore can affect their purchase intentions. This article is one the few studies that integrated multiple factors in one research framework to empirically evaluate their role in explaining consumer purchase intentions of organic foods. Results from a demographically representative sample completed by an online survey in Australia (N = 1011) provides support for the research hypotheses by revealing positive and statistically significant effects of healthism, hedonism, and trust on consumer purchase intentions. The study concludes with implications and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph. D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph. D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph. D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. Krishna B.

Through a projective approach to geometry, readers will discover connections between seemingly distant (and ancient) results in Euclidean geometry. By mixing recent results from the past 100 years with the history of the field, this text is one of the most comprehensive surveys of the subject and an invaluable reference for undergraduate and beginning graduate students learning classic geometry, as well as young researchers in computer graphics. Students will also appreciate the worked examples and diagrams throughout.},

According to the theory, the extra cost of such products is a signal of social status and wealth and leads to advantages in social interactions for the signaler. A previous study found positive evidence for the case of luxury brand labels. However, an issue of this study was that some of the experiments were not conducted in a perfectly double-blind manner. I resolved this by replicating variations of the original design in a double-blind procedure. Additionally, besides the luxury label condition, I introduced a “green” label condition. Thus, the hypothesis that signaling theory is able to explain pro-environmental behavior was tested for the first time in a natural field setting. Further, I conducted experiments in both average and below-average socioeconomic neighborhoods, where, according to signaling theory, the effects of luxury signals should be even stronger. In contrast to the original study, I did not find positive effects of the luxury brand label in any of the five experiments. Nor did I find evidence for a green-signaling effect. Moreover, in poor neighborhoods a negative tendency of the luxury label actually became evident. This suggests that a signaling theory explanation of costly labels must take into account the characteristics of the observers, e.g. their social status.},

This squib suggests an analysis of this longstanding use of they, while also describing a more recent change in they’s distribution, whereby many speakers now accept it with singular, definite, and specific antecedents of known binary gender. I argue that the distribution of they, in both conservative and innovative varieties, has implications for our understanding of the syntactic representation of gender in English, the structure of bound variable pronouns, and the regulation of coreference.},

Programming languages like Fortran, C or C++ are commonly present in these tools and, generally, the language choice was made based on the need for performance. However, this comes at a cost: safety. For instance, a common source of error is the access to invalid memory regions, which produces random execution behaviors and affects the scientific interpretation of the results.             In 2015, Mozilla Research released the first stable version of a new programming language named Rust. Many features make this new language attractive for the scientific community, it is open source and it guarantees memory safety while offering zero-cost abstraction.             We explore the advantages and drawbacks of Rust for astrophysics by re-implementing the fundamental parts of Mercury-T, a Fortran code that simulates the dynamical and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems.},

  abstract = {We examine Paul Halmos' comments on category theory, Dedekind cuts, devil worship, logic, and Robinson's infinitesimals. Halmos' scepticism about category theory derives from his philosophical position of naive set-theoretic realism. In the words of an MAA biography, Halmos thought that mathematics is "certainty" and "architecture" yet 20th century logic teaches us is that mathematics is full of uncertainty or more precisely incompleteness. If the term architecture meant to imply that mathematics is one great solid castle, then modern logic tends to teach us the opposite lession, namely that the castle is floating in midair. Halmos' realism tends to color his judgment of purely scientific aspects of logic and the way it is practiced and applied. He often expressed distaste for nonstandard models, and made a sustained effort to eliminate first-order logic, the logicians' concept of interpretation, and the syntactic vs semantic distinction. He felt that these were vague, and sought to replace them all by his polyadic algebra. Halmos claimed that Robinson's framework is "unnecessary" but Henson and Keisler argue that Robinson's framework allows one to dig deeper into set-theoretic resources than is common in Archimedean mathematics. This can potentially prove theorems not accessible by standard methods, undermining Halmos' criticisms. Keywords: Archimedean axiom; bridge between discrete and continuous mathematics; hyperreals; incomparable quantities; indispensability; infinity; mathematical realism; Robinson.},

While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two or three semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.},

  abstract = {This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture "concepts" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the "fixed points" of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.},

  abstract = {In physics, spin is often seen exclusively through the lens of its phenomenological character: as an intrinsic form of angular momentum. However, there is mounting evidence that spin fundamentally originates as a quality of geometry, not of dynamics, and recent work further suggests that the structure of non-relativistic Euclidean three-space is sufficient to define it. In this paper, we directly explicate this fundamentally non-relativistic, geometric nature of spin by constructing non-commutative algebras of position operators which subsume the structure of an arbitrary spin system. These “Spin-s Position Algebras” are defined by elementary means and from the properties of Euclidean three-space alone, and constitute a fundamentally new model for quantum mechanical systems with non-zero spin, within which neither position and spin degrees of freedom, nor position degrees of freedom within themselves, commute. This reveals that the observables of a system with spin can be described completely geometrically as tensors of oriented planar elements, and that the presence of non-zero spin in a system naturally generates a non-commutative geometry within it. We will also discuss the potential for the Spin-s Position Algebras to form the foundation for a generalisation to arbitrary spin of the Clifford and Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebras.},

  abstract = {Background: The current primary focus of programming language benchmarking studies in the literature is performance with less attention on safety. However, this context has a research gap because the software industry has focused more on software safety than performance to safeguard clients. This paper attempts to address this research gap by benchmarking languages in both safety and performance. Furthermore, this study includes Rust, a relatively new language with promising safety and performance features. Methods: This paper compares six prominent programming languages (in alphabetical order: C, C[Formula: see text], Go, Java, Python and Rust) to determine which is the best in terms of safety and performance using quantitative and qualitative methods through actual testing of code and analysis of existing information. Results: The comparisons show that Rust was the safest language, outperforming all the other languages. Regarding performance, Rust, C and C[Formula: see text] performed comparably to each other and generally outperformed Go, Java and Python. Conclusion: It is possible to achieve a superior balance of software safety and performance with, at worst, a minimal performance drop; as Rust clearly demonstrates.},

This result answers affirmatively a special case of a conjecture of               T               . Evans [2], to the effect that an               n × n               incomplete latin square with at most               n               − 1 places occupied can be completed to an               n × n               latin square. When the complete diagonal is prescribed, it is easy to see that a counterexample is provided by the case that one letter appears               n               − 1 times on the diagonal and a second letter appears once. In the present paper, we prove that except in this case the completion to a full latin square is always possible. Completion to a symmetric latin square is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Environmental deterioration caused by consumers' non-sustainable consumption pattern is putting a strain on the environment and is hindering sustainable development. In order to impede this effect and promote a more sustainable economy, one solution is to reduce or shift consumption from conventional products to green products. The unfortunate reality indicates that inadequate information on how to promote consumers' green behavioral intention is slowing the growth of green markets; such inadequacy appears as a prevailing obstacle facing firms while developing segments and communicating strategies for effectively promoting green products. The mentioned impact is more prevailing and most experienced in countries like Malaysia. Hence, consumers' behavioral intentions must be better understood in order to strengthen knowledge about fostering green purchases. This study aims to determine the motivational factors that influence green purchasing intention and simultaneously assess the moderator roles of the premium price and demographic characteristics – given that consumers' degree of greenness varies. A survey was administered and a total of 405 usable questionnaires were obtained. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test the hypotheses. Results indicate that environmental attitude, eco-label and cultural value (man–nature orientation) significantly influence the green purchase intention. The result also indicates that the premium price has no moderating effect, denying its role as one of the main barriers for consumers to walk their talk as it has previously been reported by studies and opinion polls. In addition, the findings revealed that education level and gender have a significant positive moderation effect. This suggests that green purchase intentions' motivational factors are greater among highly educated individuals especially with female consumers in particular. This study contributes to the understanding of the main factors that motivate consumers' intention to purchase green products in Malaysia. It also offers insights and discusses implementations for manufacturers, marketers and policy makers concerned with the drivers that motivate consumers' green purchasing intentions which require different marketing plan and strategy than conventional products.},

The need for green products is gradually increasing on account of persistent raise in the concern for eco friendliness. Organizations are bestowed with the responsibility of preserving the rare natural resources to meet the needs of the forthcoming generation. This paper is an attempt to bring to light the major stakeholders' apprehension over the green marketing issues. The paper begins with providing a conceptual underpinning of green marketing and moves on to categorize customers based on their level of eco friendliness. Further the paper provides an in-depth understanding of the extent of awareness as regards the green product, source of awareness, preference and level of satisfaction. The study also explores the influence of select demographic variables on the perception of the eco friendly products considered for the study. The study assumes the characteristics of exploratory and descriptive research. The data collected through a specially designed interview schedule was subjected to relevant statistical tools. The findings reported in the paper enables organizations to arrive at appropriate strategic decisions to capture the emerging eco friendly customers.},

Evidence supporting this three-way split comes from the sensitivity of certain proforms to the predicate/argument distinction, the internal structure of proforms, and the binding-theoretic properties of proforms. Recognizing different pronoun types also sheds light on the formal (dis)similarities between obviation and switch-reference.},

The moves of the game successively transform the numbers at the nodes using the amplitudes in a certain way. This game has been studied previously by Proctor, Mozes, Bjorner, Eriksson, and Wildberger. We show that those connected such graphs for which the numbers game meets a certain finiteness requirement are precisely the Dynkin diagrams associated with the finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebras. As a consequence of our proof we obtain the classifications of the finite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebras and of the finite Weyl groups. We use Coxeter group theory to establish a more general result that applies to Eriksson's E-games: an E-game meets the finiteness requirement if and only if a naturally associated Coxeter group is finite. To prove this and some other finiteness results we further develop Eriksson's theory of a geometric representation of Coxeter groups and observe some curious differences of this representation from the standard geometric representation.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Despite research studies indicating strong support for labelling information, uncertainty remains with respect to how labels influence consumers. This paper attempts to empirically investigate how consumers who differ in terms of environmentalism respond to labels. Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected on an Australian sample using a structured questionnaire administered on the phone using quantum research (CATI) data collection services. A total of 155 questionnaires were completed and used for data analysis. The data were analysed using both descriptive measures and correlations between variables. Findings – There appears to be a proportion of consumers that find product labels hard to understand. The research found that there are consumers who will buy green products even if they are lower in quality in comparison to alternative products, but would look for environmental information on labels. With respect to price sensitive green consumers, there appears to be a relationship between price sensitivity and “always” reading labels as well as indicating that there is “sufficient” information on product labels to make informed purchase decisions. Research limitations/implications – It was beyond the scope of the research to account for some of the utilitarian approaches to interpretation or in‐depth comprehension of label information. The sample size of 155, although selected using a probability method, may, to some extent, limit the overall accuracy of the results. Practical implications – The research offers some important information on different green consumer segments that would alert managers on how best to position environmental labels. Findings such as “Satisfied with labels” correlates with “Labels are accurate”, which suggests that businesses need to provide a clear, accurate and easily legible label design to encourage satisfaction with the accuracy of content and the communication aspects of a label. Originality/value – The paper contributes to better understanding of green customers purchase intentions and the usefulness of ecological product labels. It offers some insights and assistance to businesses in planning their green product/labelling strategies.},

The book is written from a minimalist perspective, providing the reader with only the most basic of notions; just enough to be able to read, and hopefully comprehend, modern research papers on these subjects. In addition, it provides a (hopefully short) preparation for the student to be able to conduct research in a variety of topics in theoretical physics; with particular emphasis on physics in curved spacetime backgrounds. The hope is that students with a minimal mathematical background in calculus and only some introductory courses in physics may be able to study this book and benefit from it.},

  abstract = {SpinQ Triangulum is the second generation of the desktop quantum computers designed and manufactured by SpinQ Technology. SpinQ's desktop quantum computer series, based on room temperature NMR spectrometer, provide light-weighted, cost-effective and maintenance-free quantum computing platforms that aim to provide real-device experience for quantum computing education for K-12 and college level. These platforms also feature quantum control design capabilities for studying quantum control and quantum noise. Compared with the first generation product, the two-qubit SpinQ Gemini, Triangulum features a three-qubit QPU, smaller dimensions (61 * 33 * 56 cm\textasciicircum 3) and lighter (40 kg). Furthermore, the magnetic field is more stable and the performance of quantum control is more accurate. This paper introduces the system design of Triangulum and its new features. As an example of performing quantum computing tasks, we present the implementation of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm on Triangulum, demonstrating Triangulum's capability of undertaking complex quantum computing tasks. SpinQ will continue to develop desktop quantum computing platform with more qubits. Meanwhile, a simplified version of SpinQ Gemini, namely Gemini Mini (https://www.spinq.cn/products\#geminiMini-anchor) , has been recently realised. Gemini Mini is much more portable (20* 35 * 26 cm\textasciicircum 3, 14 kg) and affordable for most K-12 schools around the world.},

Findings – Findings of the study highlight that environmental patterns and self-fulfilment values are those that best characterise the ecological market segment. This group of consumers is characterised by their self-fulfilment feeling. They are people who always try to improve themselves and take actions which pose a new challenge for them. They are also characterised by having an ecological lifestyle, that is, environment consciousness, selecting and recycling products and taking part in events to protect the environment. This kind of consumer would be interested in firms that are committed to the environment and launch new products, showing them as a new and exciting experience.

  abstract = {Numerous data products from the JPL ephemeris team are being made available via an interactive telnet computer service and separate web page. For over 15,000 comets and asteroids, 60 natural satellites, and 9 planets, users with an Internet connection can easily create and download information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These data include customized, high precision ephemerides, orbital and physical characteristics, and search-lists of comets and asteroids that match combinations of up to 39 different parameters. For each body, the user can request computation of more than 70 orbital and physical quantities. Ephemerides output can be generated in ICRF/J2000.0 and FK4/1950.0 reference frames with TDB, TT, or UTC timescales, as appropriate, at user specified intervals. Computed tables are derived from the same ephemerides used at JPL for radar astronomy and spacecraft navigation. The dynamics and computed observables include relativistic effects. Available ephemeris time spans currently range from A.D. 1599-2200 for the planets to a few decades for the satellites, comets and asteroids. Information on the interference from sunlight and moonlight is available. As an example of a few of the features available, we note that a user could easily generate information on satellite and planetary magnitudes, illuminated fractions, and the planetographic longitudes and latitudes of their centers and sub-solar points as seen from a particular observatory location on Earth. Satellite transits, occultations and eclipses are available as well. The resulting ASCII tables can be transferred to the user's host computer via e-mail, ftp, or kermit protocols. For those who have WWW access, the telnet solar system ephemeris service will be one feature of the JPL solar system web page. This page will provide up-to-date physical and orbital characteristics as well as current and predicted observing opportunities for all solar system bodies. Close Earth approaches and radar observations will be provided for comets and asteroids.},

The authors examine the evolutionary bases of destructive and ecologically damaging human behavior. They propose that many modern environmental and social problems are caused or exacerbated by five adaptive tendencies rooted in evolutionary history: (1) propensity for self-interest, (2) motivation for relative rather than absolute status, (3) proclivity to unconsciously copy others, (4) predisposition to be shortsighted, and (5) proneness to disregard impalpable concerns. By considering the evolutionary processes that produced these tendencies, the authors present ways that marketers, policy makers, and social entrepreneurs can harness evolved human tendencies to lessen or even eradicate environmental and social problems. From an evolutionary perspective, optimally effective influence strategies must work with humans’ evolved tendencies, rather than ignoring them or working against them.},

This paper outlines a framework that explains how purpose branding is performed in practice. Such a framework is lacking from the extant scholarship, the key reasons for which can be found in the research limitations in previous studies. We argue that studies on brand purpose should include new theoretical categories: consumer empowerment and transformation of practices. We advance this idea based on the theory of social practices. Using case studies of purpose-branding campaigns, we discuss how brand purpose empowers consumers and fosters transformations of their practices. We present a framework that explains how purpose branding works using the categories suggested.},

  abstract = {This article explores the evolution of language, focusing on insights derived from observations and experiments in animals, guided by current theoretical problems that were inspired by the generative theory of grammar, and carried forward in substantial ways to the present by psycholinguists working on child language acquisition. We suggest that over the past few years, there has been a shift with respect to empirical studies of animals targeting questions of language evolution. In particular, rather than focus exclusively on the ways in which animals communicate, either naturally or by means of artificially acquired symbol systems, more recent work has focused on the underlying computational mechanisms subserving the language faculty and the ability of nonhuman animals to acquire these in some form. This shift in emphasis has brought biologists studying animals in closer contact with linguists studying the formal aspects of language, and has opened the door to a new line of empirical inquiry that we label evolingo. Here we review some of the exciting new findings in the evolingo area, focusing in particular on aspects of semantics and syntax. With respect to semantics, we suggest that some of the apparently distinctive and uniquely linguistic conceptual distinctions may have their origins in nonlinguistic conceptual representations; as one example, we present data on nonhuman primates and their capacity to represent a singular–plural distinction in the absence of language. With respect to syntax, we focus on both statistical and rule-based problems, especially the most recent attempts to explore different layers within the Chomsky hierarchy; here, we discuss work on tamarins and starlings, highlighting differences in the patterns of results as well as differences in methodology that speak to potential issues of learnability. We conclude by highlighting some of the exciting questions that lie ahead, as well as some of the methodological challenges that face both comparative and developmental studies of language evolution.},

Facing treason and rebellion on two fronts, Alia's rule is not absolute. The displaced House Corrino is plotting to regain the throne while the fanatical Fremen are being provoked into open revolt by the enigmatic figure known only as The Preacher. Alia believes that by obtaining the secrets of the twins' prophetic visions, she can maintain control over her dynasty.

  abstract = {SpinQ Gemini is a commercial desktop quantum computer designed and manufactured by SpinQ Technology. It is an integrated hardware-software system. The first generation product with two qubits was launched in January 2020. The hardware is based on NMR spectrometer, with permanent magnets providing \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ T magnetic field. SpinQ Gemini operates under room temperature (\$0\$-\$30\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$C), highlighting its lightweight (55 kg with a volume of \$70\textbackslash times 40 \textbackslash times 80\$ cm\$\textasciicircum 3\$), cost-effective (under \$50\$k USD), and maintenance-free. SpinQ Gemini aims to provide real-device experience for quantum computing education for K-12 and at the college level. It also features quantum control design capabilities that benefit the researchers studying quantum control and quantum noise. Since its first launch, SpinQ Gemini has been shipped to institutions in Canada, Taiwan and Mainland China. This paper introduces the system of design of SpinQ Gemini, from hardware to software. We also demonstrate examples for performing quantum computing tasks on SpinQ Gemini, including one task for a variational quantum eigensolver of a two-qubit Heisenberg model. The next generations of SpinQ quantum computing devices will adopt models of more qubits, advanced control functions for researchers with comparable cost, as well as simplified models for much lower cost (under \$5\$k USD) for K-12 education. We believe that low-cost portable quantum computer products will facilitate hands-on experience for teaching quantum computing at all levels, well-prepare younger generations of students and researchers for the future of quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, sustainable supply chain has become an exciting concept during the academic societies. This paper considers environmental and economic aspect of sustainability. Due to environmental concerns, the entry of green products into today's markets is on the rise. How to compete for the production of green products with non-green products is essential in these markets. Therefore, this research focuses on the pricing and determination of the degree of greenness of a product in competition with a non-green product. This study, for the first time, investigates the pricing of two substitute products, a green product produced by one manufacturer and a non-green product produced by a second manufacturer, under two dual-channel supply chains including retail and internet channels. The decision variables for one manufacturer are the price and degrees of eco-friendliness of the green product; for the other, the decision variable is the price of the non-green product. This problem is solved under two different scenarios: centralized and decentralized. In the decentralized scenario, a Stackelberg competition is considered between the retailer level and the manufacturer level of the total supply chains in which the manufacturers are assumed to be the leader, and the retailers are the followers. In the centralized scenario, players in each of their related supply chain are integrated. The problem is solved and compared under two scenarios. Finally, both parametric and numerical analyses are presented and some managerial insights are provided and some of which are as follows: The centralized scenario cause to achieve high the green degree comparing with the decentralized scenario.},

It has survived censorship, controversy and legal action, and even been deemed blasphemous, but remains an undisputed modernist classic: ceaselessly inventive, garrulous, funny, sorrowful, vulgar, lyrical and ultimately redemptive. It confirms Joyce's belief that literature ‘is the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man’.},

  abstract = {Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries as energy storage system. As this battery technology shows degradation during service life, lifetime analyses are of interest to understand aging phenomena and to optimize batteries and their operation. For these analyses, we have carried out laboratory aging tests. Test conditions were defined according to the three main operation types: inactivity, driving and charging periods. The results show that battery lifetime depends on many operation parameters and, for different types of operation, different aging characteristics are observed. One of our findings is that calendar aging has a substantial impact on battery life due to the prevailing inactivity periods. Charging of the batteries also has a strong influence on the achievable lifetime. Especially for high charging rates and low temperatures, the severe aging mechanism lithium plating is known to emerge as a result from increased anode over-potentials. The phenomenon of nonlinear aging, which describes an accelerated aging rate at residual capacities of approximately 80\%, is closely related to lithium plating. A reduction of the charging current can postpone or even avoid nonlinear aging. We propose a new charging method that keeps the charging time short and simultaneously avoids accelerated aging. The adaptation of the charging current is correlated to the aging state of the battery.},

The book focuses on the continuous spectral of the stars and the mass-luminosity relationship. The text discusses the technique of dimensional analysis, covering both relativistic phenomena and the stellar systems. The book also explains the fundamental conclusion of dimensional analysis, wherein the unknown functions shall be given certain specified forms. The Wien and Stefan-Boltzmann Laws can be significant in the systematic application of dimensional analysis to the physics of a single star. The text also discusses group-theoretical reduction of ordinary differential equations and the reductions of the differential equations of stellar structure. The structure of a stellar envelope requires three hypotheses: (1) thermo-nuclear reactions as source of energy of stellar; (2) thermo-nuclear reactions occur at the star's core; and (3) that an envelope surrounding the core exists where no radiation is generated. To complete the model of a star, the investigator should have further assumptions such as the pressure is made-up of gas, radiation, or both. The book can prove helpful for astronomers, astro-physicists, cosmologists, and students of general physics.},

Recent advancements in “Big Data” analytics and related statistical/computational tools raised interest in data-driven battery health estimation. Here, we will review these in view of their feasibility and cost-effectiveness in dealing with battery health in real-world applications. We categorise these methods according to their underlying models/algorithms and discuss their advantages and limitations. In the final section we focus on challenges of real-time battery health management and discuss potential next-generation techniques. We are confident that this review will inform commercial technology choices and academic research agendas alike, thus boosting progress in data-driven battery health estimation and prediction on all technology readiness levels.},

  abstract = {Recently, prominent theoretical linguists have argued for an explicit scenario for the evolution of the human language capacity on the basis of its computational properties. Concretely, the simplicity of a minimalist formulation of the operation Merge, which allows humans to recursively compute hierarchical relations in language, has been used to promote a sudden-emergence, single-mutation scenario. In support of this view, Merge is said to be either fully present or fully absent: one cannot have half-Merge. On this basis, it is inferred that the emergence of our fully fledged language capacity had to be sudden. Thus, proponents of this view draw a parallelism between the formal complexity of the operation at the computational level and the number of evolutionary steps it must imply. Here, we examine this argument in detail and show that the jump from the atomicity of Merge to a singlemutation scenario is not valid and therefore cannot be used as justification for a theory of language evolution along those lines.},

  abstract = {This report aims to give an overview of the current knowledge about reuse and recycling of lithium-ion batteries. The work has been commissioned by the Swedish Energy Agency with the purpose to identify any gaps in knowledge and technical know-how required to make the end-of-life chain for lithium-ion batteries more efficient in order to ensure that future funding of research in the area is used effectively and where it is mostly needed. The research review mainly comprises peer-reviewed research articles published in English, as well as known research projects in Sweden, the EU and the US in the areas of collection, reuse, recycling, batteries' environmental impact and design for recycling. To put the findings in context the report also includes a background section with data on the global market for reuse and recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries differ from other battery types in several ways. They usually have longer lifespan than other batteries such as lead-acid batteries. They are also more often built into equipment and cannot easily be disposed of separately by the user. This contributes to the fact that it takes longer time for the batteries to reach recycling and that they are exported to a greater extent than other batteries for reuse purposes, which means that they are not recycled in Sweden or not even in Europ. This has caused a perception that recycling is underdeveloped while it’s in fact works well. At least in the countries where the batteries end up, primarily in China and South Korea. That the public perception is out of sync with reality could have to do with the fact that research within both generation and collection of end-of-life batteries is very sparse. Only a few studies in China, Japan and the United States have focused on how batteries reach recycling and what prevents more of them from doing so. In addition, most research has been done on the collection of mixed portable batteries. Little has been written about how batteries reach end-of- life or what life span they can be expected to have. Reuse, or Second Life, is considerably better covered. As a rule, these studies have one of three different focuses: economic potential, technical possibilities and limitations, and which environmental consequences reuse of batteries entail. Most studies are fairly small and there is a clear need to study larger systems. The conclusions are positive. Recycling is the area which is best covered. More than 300 studies featuring primary research have been found where various types of methods have been tried to separate different substances from waste batteries and to re-produce cathode material or precursors. More than 75 percent of the studies have been done on hydrometallurgical processes and 70 percent were carried out by scientists in China or South Korea. Most of these have been focused on the treatment of LCO and NCM batteries, while only a few studies have been done on LFP, LMO and NCA batteries. The results show that all active materials including lithium can be recycled with high efficiency. There are a number of areas where research is completely lacking. Several of these have great significance for the entire recycling chain, especially from an industrial point of view. For example, there is very little done on sorting and classification of batteries, about discharging and pre-treatment, and not least in design for reuse and recycling. What is remarkable is also how absent areas such as safety, work environment and transport are in the overall research. Research ahead should focus on issues that currently prevent effective recycling. It should also promote an increased system understanding among all players involved. In reuse, there is still an opportunity for the research community to be pioneers and obtain data and experiences that can form the basis for strategic, long-term decisions for the industry. Finally, it may be justified in Sweden to conduct research in areas that are already well covered globally with the aim of strengthening the knowledge in the country.},

  abstract = {With battery energy storage technology development, the centralized battery energy storage system (CBESS) has a broad prospect in developing electricity. In the meantime, the retired lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles (EV) offer a new option for battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper studies the centralized reused battery energy storage system (CRBESS) in South Australia by replacing the new lithium-ion batteries with lithium-ion second-life batteries (SLB) and evaluating the economic benefits with economic indicators as net present value (NPV), discounted payback period (DPBP), Internal rate of return (IRR) to depict a comprehensive understanding of the development potential of the CRBESS with the lithium-ion SLB as the energy storage system. This paper proposes a calculation method of frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) revenue referring to market share rate (MSR) when building the economic model. Moreover, the residual value of lithium-ion batteries is considered. This paper uses the economic model to calculate the profitability and development potential of CRBESS. From an economic perspective, the superiority and feasibility of CRBESS compared with CBESS were analyzed.},

That's because, just like programming, category theory is about structure. Mathematicians discover structure in mathematical theories, programmers discover structure in computer programs. Well-structured programs are easier to understand and maintain and are less likely to contain bugs.

  abstract = {Consumers are paying close attention to green products to reduce the environmental impact on health issues. As the scope of this research, this current study focuses on determining consumers’ purchase decisions regarding green products using a survey conducted in a fast-growing developing country. This research was descriptive and considered a conceptual framework for extending the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which was selected as the primary theoretical model. The significant contributions and main objectives of this study are as follows—to explore the present scenario of green marketing in Bangladesh with previous studies, and to fill a research gap regarding green purchase decisions by applying the TPB model with adding additional constructs, such as environmental concerns, green perceived quality, and future green estimates. A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques were adopted to collect data from the target groups, where a sample of young educated Bangladeshi consumers (n = 638) was used to consider the measurement and structural models by applying a partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. The empirical findings show that consumers’ environmental concern (EC), green perceived benefits (GPB), green awareness of price (GAP), green willingness to purchase (GWP), and future estimation of green marketing (GFE) have a strong positive influence on consumer’ green purchase decision (GPD). Still, the green perceived quality (GPQ) has a negative influence on green purchase decisions (GPD). To inform consumers about green or eco-friendly products, this study provides valuable suggestions to companies, marketers, and policymakers for designing green marketing tools such as green advertising, green branding, and eco-labels. Based on these findings, it gives some managerial insights for the promotion of green products and green marketing.},

Across seven experiments, displays of luxury — manipulated through brand labels on clothes — elicited different kinds of preferential treatment, which even resulted in financial benefits to people who engaged in conspicuous consumption. Furthermore, we tested preconditions in which the beneficial consequences of conspicuous consumption may arise and determined the proximate mechanisms underlying them. The present data suggest that luxury consumption can be a profitable social strategy because conspicuous displays of luxury qualify as a costly signaling trait that elicits status-dependent favorable treatment in human social interactions.},

We then classify conformal transformations of the sphere, define the notion of null infinity in Minkowski space-time, and show that the action of Lorentz transformations on the celestial spheres at null infinity is precisely that of conformal transformations. In particular, we discuss the optical phenomena observed by the pilots of the "Millenium Falcon" during the jump to lightspeed.},

A representational system for the description of contextual factors which interact with the grammar and the influence of these contextual factors upon the grammar in Pirahã is then proposed within and elaborating upon the model of FDG.

Marketing practitioners and academics are attempting to identify and understand green consumers and their needs, and to develop market offerings that meet these needs. So far there is little consensus about the identity and nature of green consumers, except that they have been something of a disappointment to the marketers who have pursued them. These difficulties perhaps reflect the folly of trying to understand green consumption and green marketing by viewing it as simply a variation on conventional marketing. This article proposes some different ways of looking at green consumption and green marketing, which have the potential to prevent the hunt for the green consumer from deteriorating into a wild goose chase.

  abstract = {Using a purely Newtonian model for the Solar system, we investigate the dynamics of comet 1P/Halley considering in particular the Lyapunov and power spectra of its orbit, using the nominal initial conditions of JPL’s Horizons system. We carry out precise numerical integrations of the (N + 1)-restricted problem and the first variational equations, considering a time span of 2~×~105~yr. The power spectra are dominated by a broad-band component, with peaks located at the current planetary frequencies, including contributions from Jupiter, Venus, the Earth and Saturn, as well as the 1 : 6 resonance among Halley and Jupiter and higher harmonics. From the average value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent we estimate the Lyapunov time of the comet’s nominal orbit, obtaining τL ≃ 562~yr; the remaining independent Lyapunov exponents (not related by time-reversal symmetry) tend asymptotically to zero as t−1/2. Yet, our results do not display convergence of the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We argue that the lack of convergence of the maximum Lyapunov exponent is a signature of transient chaos which will lead to an eventual ejection of the comet from the Solar system.},

The SCT framework provides a dynamic perspective on sustainable consumption through exploring the interactive nature of personal, environmental and behavioral factors of consumption. The SCT framework, which builds on prior theoretical models of sustainable consumption, incorporates the concept of reciprocal determinism, wherein personal, environmental and behavioral factors create a feedback loop to influence each other. Two examples, toy sharing in New Zealand and water conservation in Australia, illustrate the dynamic nature of sustainable consumption and the potential of an SCT based framework to provide a more nuanced view of behavioral change in this context. From these two examples, several ideas for future research emerge to help illustrate the potential of SCT to inform and inspire the next wave of research on sustainable consumption.},

Despite their continued widespread adoption, methods to recycle and reuse end-of-life (EOL) LIB materials are still under active development. In the first part of this two-part review on LIB recycling, we review current commercial scale processes in practice for recycling or reusing EOL LIB components. Future waste projections estimate 4 million tons of cumulative EOL EV battery modules by 2030, which is above the current global recycling capacity. All of the processes in use today utilize a combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical or mechanical and hydrometallurgical processing to recover mainly cobalt and nickel and copper, while other components are disposed as waste unless further processed. In this review, we highlight the need for recycling LIB material components based on resource availability and the current processes in practice to recover and recycle LIBs.},

  abstract = {In the future, customer value will be achieved not only through the realization of a product or a service but also through socially and environmentally responsible and economically efficient manufacturing processes encouraging positive effects for society. Distributed Manufacturing Systems (DMS) are currently discussed in science as a possible approach for sustainable manufacturing. This approach consists largely of the use of decentralized, adaptable and flexible mini-factories. Such production units, organized in networks, allow production-on-demand and therefore the reduction of transport and emissions. In addition, they support the growth and development of regional economic cycles. This paper proposes an increased application of DMS in emerging markets to achieve sustainable production. First, actual challenges of production in emerging markets with a special focus on sustainability are described. In a literature review, the actual state of the art in sustainable manufacturing and distributed manufacturing is presented. Second, the concept of DMS is explained, describing reasons for a trend toward distributed manufacturing. In the next section, the effect of DMS on sustainability in production in emerging markets is analyzed based on the traditional dimensions of sustainability. The paper closes with a critical discussion of DMS and an outlook on future needs in research.},

The Rater Entity type largely determines reliability, which is a precision-of-score estimate for a particular application of the scale.},

There is also price contest between green and non green producer as the demands of the products are dependent on sales price, carbon emission and corporate social responsibility index. Assuming the cost and profit parameters, an expected profit function of the systems is formulated and maximized analytically.

The quaternions, arising naturally as part of the Clifford algebra of a quadratic space, solve many such issues with SO(3), and an understanding of the Clifford algebra reveals that it contains several structures, useful for representing subspaces and transformations, which all work together harmoniously. Selif showed how to apply a Clifford algebra to escape the origin and describe SE(3) in the same way. This application of a degenerate Clifford algebra to metric affine geometry inspires the discovery of a new decomposition of the algebra with a clear geometric interpretation, inducing in turn decompositions of each of its contained structures via functors. A curious family of outer derivations of a degenerate Clifford algebra is also revealed.},

However, few studies have evaluated this recruitment method in Canada, fewer still targeting older adults, and, to our knowledge, none specifically in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL).                                         Objective               This study aimed to assess Facebook advertising as an economical means of recruiting a representative sample of adults aged 35 to 74 years in NL for a cross-sectional health survey.                                         Methods               Facebook advertising was used to recruit for a Web-based survey on cancer awareness and prevention during April and May 2018; during recruitment, additional advertisements were targeted to increase representation of demographics that we identified as being underrepresented in our sample. Sociodemographic and health characteristics of the study sample were compared with distributions of the underlying population to determine representativeness. Cramer V indicates the magnitude of the difference between the sample and population distributions, interpreted as small (Cramer V=0.10), medium (0.30), and large (0.50). Sample characteristics were considered representative if there was no statistically significant difference in distributions (chi-square P{$>$}.01) or if the difference was small (V≤0.10), and practically representative if 0.10},

At one hand, this means that consumerism is on the rise, but on the other hand, this puts businesses under extreme pressure to innovate and take future proofing actions. The traditional approach of take-make-dispose for consumer products is being challenged by circular economy and sustainability practices across the value chain. These practices can provide companies with competitive advantage through resource efficiency. Latest market research shows that consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for environmental and social performance of companies in addition to financial performance, leading to heightened expectations from their preferred brands. Leading companies are cognizant of these changes and increasing risks posed by social and environmental issues. As a result, companies are taking strategic approach in the context of positively impacting environmental and social ecosystem both inside and outside the business. This has an impact on marketing and brand communication. This chapter discusses industry approaches on using sustainability performance as a tool for marketing across various economies.},

  abstract = {Like Carl Darling Buck's Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin (1933), this book is an explanation of the similarities and differences between Greek and Latin morphology and lexicon through an account of their prehistory. It also aims to discuss the principal features of Indo-European linguistics. Greek and Latin are studied as a pair for cultural reasons only; as languages, they have little in common apart from their Indo-European heritage. Thus the only way to treat the historical bases for their development is to begin with Proto-Indo-European. The only way to make a reconstructed language like Proto-Indo-European intelligible and intellectually defensible is to present at least some of the basis for reconstructing its features and, in the process, to discuss reasoning and methodology of reconstruction (including a weighing of alternative reconstructions). The result is a compendious handbook of Indo-European phonology and morphology, and a vade mecum of Indo-European linguistics--the focus always remaining on Greek and Latin. The non-classical sources for historical discussion are mainly Vedic Sanskrit, Hittite, and Germanic, with occasional but crucial contributions from Old Irish, Avestan, Baltic, and Slavic.},

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  location = {Princeton, N.J},
  abstract = {With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory. Thoroughly developing a subject with many ramifications, while striking a careful balance between conceptual insights and the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis, Complex Analysis will be welcomed by students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which Complex Analysis is the second, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.},

  abstract = {"The goal of this Third Edition is the same as previous editions: to provide a good foundation, and a joyful experience, or anyone who'd like to learn about nonlinear dynamics and chaos from an applied perspective. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, strange attractors, and synchronization. The prerequisites are comfort with multivariable calculus and linear algebra, as well as a first course in physics. Changes to this edition include substantial exercises about conceptual models of climate change, an updated treatment of the SIR model of epidemics, and amendments (based on recent research) about the Selkov model of oscillatory glycolysis. Equations, diagrams, and explanations have been reconsidered and often revised. There are also about 50 new references, many from the recent literature. The most notable change is a new chapter about the Kuramoto model. This icon of nonlinear dynamics, introduced in 1975 by the Japanese physicist Yoshiki Kuramoto, is one of the rare examples of a high-dimensional nonlinear system that can be solved by elementary means. It provides an entrée to current research on complex systems, synchronization, and networks, yet is accessible to newcomers. Students and teachers have embraced the book in the past for its exceptional clarity and rich applications, and its general approach and framework continue to be sound"--},

  abstract = {This new Fifth Edition of Principles of Lasers incorporates corrections to the previous edition. The text’s essential mission remains the same: to provide a wide-ranging yet unified description of laser behavior, physics, technology, and current applications. Dr. Svelto emphasizes the physical rather than the mathematical aspects of lasers, and presents the subject in the simplest terms compatible with a correct physical understanding. Praise for earlier editions: "Professor Svelto is himself a longtime laser pioneer and his text shows the breadth of his broad acquaintance with all aspects of the field … Anyone mastering the contents of this book will be well prepared to understand advanced treatises and research papers in laser science and technology." (Arthur L. Schawlow, 1981 Nobel Laureate in Physics) "Already well established as a self-contained introduction to the physics and technology of lasers … Professor Svelto’s book, in this lucid translation by David Hanna, can be strongly recommended for self-study or teaching at the final-year undergraduate or first-year post-graduate levels." (Physics Bulletin) "A thorough understanding of this book in conjunction with one of the existing volumes on laser safety will go a long way in providing the health physicist with the understanding he needs … Highly recommended." (Health Physics) "Introduces laser science and technology with the accessibility appropriate for the nonspecialist and the enthusiasm of the pioneer." (Laser Focus) "A very good introduction to laser theory and practice … aimed at upper-level undergraduate students. It is logically organized and easy to read … Most of the basic mathematical framework needed to understand this evolving field is presented. Every chapter contains a good set of problems, answers to some of which are given in the back." (Sci-Tech News) Orazio Svelto is Professor of Quantum Electronics at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and Director of the Quantum Electronics Center of the Italian National Research Council. His research has covered a wide range of activity in the field of laser physics and quantum electronics, starting from the very beginning of these disciplines. This activity includes ultrashort-pulse generation and applications, development of laser resonators and mode-selection techniques, laser applications in biology and medicine, and development of solid-state lasers. Professor Svelto is the author of more than 150 scientific papers and his researches have been the subject of more than 50 invited papers and international conferences. He has served as a program chair of the IX International Quantum Electronics Conference (1976), as a chair of the European program committee for CLEO ’85 and CLEO ’90, and he was general co-chair for the first CLEO-Europe Conference (1994). He is an elected member of the Italian "Accademia dei XL" and a Fellow of the IEEE.},

In this experiment, a number of cells were stored in a variety of static aging environments ranging from 25°C and 60\% SOC to 55°C and 100\% SOC. The power output of each cell was monitored regularly over the course of 44 weeks via a low current level hybrid pulse power characterization test. A single empirical model of power fade, involving two concurrent degradation processes, was found to be applicable over a wide range of experimental conditions. The first degradation process is relatively rapid (nearly complete within 4 weeks) and is accelerated by temperature with unknown kinetics. The second degradation process (accelerated by temperature and SOC) is less rapid and exhibits time3/2 kinetics.},

  abstract = {Electrification of vehicles is one solution in reducing emissions from the transport sector, and in particular to limit tail-pipe emissions in cities. In order to make the electrification successful and cost effective, there is a high demand for longer drive range and longer battery lifetime. By improving the understanding for the underlying aging mechanisms of vehicle lithium ion batteries, the utilization can be improved and thus cost effective. This thesis contributes with an extensive test matrix for lifetime testing, including calendar and cycling aging, on large commercial cells for automotive applications. The test matrix is constructed to investigate the effect of temperature, C-rate, SOC level, test procedure and DOD. A physics-based model including SEI formation, film resistance increase and loss of electrode volume fraction as a function of number of cycles is constructed. Aging parameters were determined through parameterizing the model using calibration experiments. Lifetime cycling data show that the expected temperature dependence can not be seen for 10\% DOD for SOC levels below 50\% SOC, it is first for SOC levels higher than 60\% that this is observed. Also SOC levels higher than 30\% is accelerating the aging, while SOC levels below this show very low aging effects, however, when using cycling in the whole SOC interval, the classical decreased lifetime with higher temperatures were obtained. For cells tested in different DODs, but with the same cut-off voltage, longer lifetime was observed for the small DOD, although the initial aging was similar up to 1200 FCE. After that, the aging decelerated for the small DODs while it accelerated for the large DODs.},

  abstract = {Mars is populated by Martians and anti-Martians, who live in a network of cities connected by one-way roads. There may be many roads, or none at all, between any two cities. Martians and anti-Martians annihilate each other in any given city, so that each city contains only Martians or only anti-Martians or is empty. Occasionally a city A mutates; its inhabitants all change their ‘type’ (that is Martians turn into anti-Martians and vice versa) while any city B with at least one road leading to A clones its own population sufficiently to send a copy of its population down every road leading to A while leaving its own population intact. These arriving armies at A cancel or add to give the new population at A. Thus a mutation at A changes only the population of A. Here is an example of three cities A,B,C with populations 3,4 and 10 respectively.},

  abstract = {This laboratory experiment explores the characteristics of the Gaussian beam and its propagation, a two-mirror optical cavity, and the coupling of the Gaussian beam to the optical cavity. The first portion of the experiment seeks to characterize the Gaussian beam from a He-Ne laser. The second part provides some experience in designing the mode matching system to couple the Gaussian beam into an optical cavity. The third part seeks to provide some experience in aligning two mirrors to form a cavity such that the input laser beam is reasonably well-coupled into the system. One of the cavity mirrors is scanned back and forth using a piezo element so that the length of the cavity changes in a periodic manner. An array of different spatial modes will be observed as the length is changed slowly. You may characterize the optical cavity by measuring its free spectral range and finesse.},
