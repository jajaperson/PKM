# PKM

The public part of my PKM, managed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md),
exported with [obsidian-copy](https://github.com/jajaperson/obsidian-copy),
and rendered on the web with [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

## Viewing locally with Obsidian

Clone the repository and open `content/` in Obsidian.
This should include all necessary plugins.
