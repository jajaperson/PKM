# Welcome to my digital garden!

This site contains the portion of the notes I have been writing since I started university in 2022. 
As such, there is a bit of a range in sophistication — and potentially accuracy.
The notes cover anything that has taken my interest over the years from [[Old Icelandic MOC|Old Icelandic]] to [[Topology MOC|topology]]. 
Feel free to explore, either by searching with <kbd>⌘K</kbd> or using the entry points below.

Keep in mind that greyed out links can either be notes I haven't decided to make public,
or otherwise haven't gotten around to writing yet.
Also, I still have a bit of work to do before these notes look completely correct when viewing on the web.
