# Class

A **class** is a [[Collection]] of different things with [[Propositional equality]] which may not be a [[set]],
though the exact meaning depends on the [[Foundation of mathematics|foundation]] being used.
Thus it is a generalization of a [[small set]].
A [[Proper class]] is a class which is not a set.
A [[Subclass]] generalizes a subset.
A mapping between classes is a [[Class function]].


## Foundation-agnostic usage

We often use the word class in [[Foundation-agnostic mathematics|foundation-agnostic]] contexts.
The appropriate interpretations are then:

- In a theory like [[ZF]] one may treat a class indirectly as a [[predicate]] $\Phi$ ranging over sets and possibly [[urelement|urelements]]
    and we say $x \in \Phi$ iff $\Phi(x)$.
- In an extension such as [[NBG]], a class becomes an object in its own right which largely supersedes the notion of a set,
    with a set becoming a class which is contained in some class.
    Classhood of $x$ is denoted by $\chood(x)$.
    Again, classes are taken to satisfy the [[Axiom of Extensionality]]
- In [[TG]] a $\mathcal{U}$-class is a subset of $\mathcal{U}$.
- Similarly, in a [[Type theory]] with [[Type theoretic universe|universes]] a class is the same as an [[h-Set|h-set]].
