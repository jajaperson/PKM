# Velocity selector for charged particles
The **velocity selector** is a mechanism for filtering charged particles by velocity,
enabled by the [[Lorentz force law]].
The setup involves **crossed fields**,
that is an [[Electric field]] running perpendicular to the magnetic one.
Particles of varied velocity are fired perpendicular to both of these fields,
and as such experience two deflecting forces:
an electric force in one direction and a magnetic [[Lorentz force law|Lorentz force]] in the other.
At a specific speed determined by the respective strength of these fields,
these two forces are equal and cancel out,
whereby the particle passes through undeflected.
$$
\begin{align*}
\abs{\vab F_{e}} &= \abs{\vab F_{m}} \\
\abs{q}\abs{E} &= \abs{q}\abs{\vab v}\abs{\vab B} \sin\theta \\
\abs{\vab E} &= \abs{\vab v}\abs{\vab B} \\
\\
\implies \abs{\vab v} &= \frac{\abs{\vab E}}{\abs{\vab B}}
\end{align*}
$$
