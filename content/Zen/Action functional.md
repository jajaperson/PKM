# Action functional

Let $M$ be an $m$-dimensional $C^\alpha$-[[manifold]].
An **action functional**, also called a **variational integral**,[^2004]
is a [[functional]] on some space $F$ of smooth maps from $M$
of the form
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{L}[f] = \int_{M} L[f]
\end{align*}
$$
for some map into [[Differential form|top forms]]
$$
\begin{align*}
L : F \to \Omega^m(M)
\end{align*}
$$
called the **Lagrangian**.

## Further terminology

- A pair consisting of a space of fields and a lagrangian is a [[Lagrangian field theory]].
- A Lagrangian which depends smoothly only on the base point $x \in M$ and partial derivatives of $f$ up to order $k$ is called a [[Local Lagrangian]] of order $k$.
