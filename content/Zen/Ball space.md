# Ball space

The **$n$-ball** $\mathbb{B}^n$ is usually defined as the closed unit-ball in $n$-dimensional [[Real coördinate space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{B}^n = \{ v \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|v\| \leq 1 \} \sube \mathbb{R}^n
\end{align*}
$$
along with the subspace metric and [[subspace topology]].
Its boundary is the $(n-1)$-[[Sphere space]].

## Properties

- The $n$-ball is a [[Compact space]].
- [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem]]
- [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem#Corollaries|Retraction theorem]]
