# Free-forgetful adjunction

A **free-forgetful adjunction** is a very common way of constructing [[adjoint functor|adjoint functors]].
It is common that one deals with two categories $\cat C, \cat D$ where the objects of $\cat C$ carry “more” information that the objects of $\cat C$ in some sense,
and $\cat C$ is a (often not full) [[subcategory]] of $\cat D$.
There is thus an inclusion $U : \cat C \to \cat D$ which “forgets” this information, known as a **forgetful functor**.
If it exists, a [[Adjoint functor|left-adjoint]] $F \dashv U$ constructs “the most general” or “freëst” $\cat C$-object from a $\cat D$-object.

## Examples

- [[Free category]]
- [[Free module]]
- [[Free group]]
