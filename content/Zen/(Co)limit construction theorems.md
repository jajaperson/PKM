# (Co)limit construction theorems

**(Co)limit construction theorems** allow for the computation of [[Limits and colimits|(co)limits]] in terms of other limits. Namely #m/thm/cat 

- All [[Limits and colimits|(co)limits]] are constructable from [[Products and coproducts|(co)products]] and [[Equalizer and coëqualizer|(co)equalizers]];
- All finite [[Limits and colimits|(co)limits]] are constructable from binary [[Products and coproducts|(co)products]] and binary [[Equalizer and coëqualizer|(co)equalizers]];
- All finite [[Limits and colimits|(co)limits]] are constructable from [[Fibre product and coproduct|fibre (co)products]] and a [[Initial and terminal objects|(co)initial object]].
