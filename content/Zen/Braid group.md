# Braid group

Let $X$ be a topological space,
and $X \choose n$ denote the space of subsets of $X$ of cardinality $n$.[^1]
The **braid group** $\mathfrak{B}_{n}(X)$ on $n$ strands in $X$ is the [[fundamental group]]
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{B}_{n}(X) = \pi_{1} {X \choose n}.
\end{align*}
$$
In the special case $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ is the [[Euclidean plane]], we have the [[Artin braid group]].

[^1]: The natural topology on $X \choose n$ is that of the [[orbit space]] ([[quotient topology]]) of [[Symmetric group|$\mathrm S_n$]] acting on the [[Subspace topology|subspace topology]] of the [[Product topology|product space]] $X^n \setminus \Delta$ where $\Delta$ consists of points with at least two components the same.
