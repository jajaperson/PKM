# Separation of variables (differential equations)
Separation of variables is a technique 
for solving a first order ordinary differential equation of the form
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = F(x)G(y)
\end{align*}
$$
which can be solved by _separating_ the $x$ and $y$ terms
$$
\begin{align*}
\int{F(x) \, dx} - \int{\frac{dy}{G(y)}}
\end{align*}
$$
An ODE which can be solved this way is called **separable**.
