# Yoneda perspective

The so-called **Yoneda perspective** is the idea that everything one might want to know about an object is encoded in the morphisms into it, or by duality, out of it.
This is justified by the existence of the [[Yoneda embedding]],
whose properties are given by the [[Yoneda lemma]].
The theorem is #m/cat/thm
$$
\begin{align*}
\yo A \cong \yo B \iff A \cong B
\end{align*}
$$
