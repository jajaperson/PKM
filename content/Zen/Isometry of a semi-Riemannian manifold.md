# Isometry of a semi-Riemannian manifold

Let $(M,g)$ be a [[Semi-Riemannian manifold|semi-Riemannian $C^\alpha$-manifold]].
An **isometry** $\varphi \in \opn{Iso}(M,g)$ is a $C^\alpha$-[[diffeomorphism]] $\varphi : M \to M$ which preserves the metric, #m/def/geo/diff 
i.e. the [[Differential pullback along a diffeomorphism|pullback]] $\varphi_{*}g_{ab}$ satisfyies $\varphi_{*}g_{ab} = g_{ab}$.
The isometries form a [[Lie group]] $\opn{Iso}(M,g)$,
whose corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{iso}(M,g)$ consists of [[Killing field|Killing fields]].
