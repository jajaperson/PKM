# Vowels in Swedish
Swedish has a total of nine long-short vowel pairs,
making a total of eighteen vocalic phonemes[^neut].
A basic summary is followed[^2008][^broad]:

[^broad]: Note /◌/ here _should not_ be taken to represent unique phonemes,
  as long-short pairs are typically considered allophones of the same phoneme.
  See discussion below, especially [[#Vowel paradigm]].

-  ‹i› /iː/ and /ɪ/
- ‹e› /eː/ and /e/[^neut]
- ‹ä› /ɛː/ and /ɛ/
- ‹a› /αː/ and /a/
- ‹å› /oː/ and /ɔ/
- ‹o› /uː/ and /ʊ/
- ‹u› /ʉː/ and /ɵ/
- ‹y› /yː/ and /ʏ/[^round]
- ‹ö› /øː/ and /œ/

[^2008]: 2008\. [[Sources/@holmesSwedishEssentialGrammar2008|Swedish: an essential grammar]]
[^neut]: As noted below in [[#Vowel paradigm]], 
  short ‹e› and ‹ä› have neutralised. 
  Herefore we have eight short vowels to match nine long ones.
[^round]: The place of articulation of the ‹u› pair and the ‹y› pair are largely the same in central dialects:
  contrast instead comes from [[Types of roundedness]]:
  compressed ‹◌ᵝ› and protruded ‹◌ʷ›. 

Many phonologists take up the view that vowel length (monomoraic or bimoraic)
is entirely predictable by environment,
and hence contrast comes from the consonants around the vowel[^2014].
For a summary of the environments in which long and short forms are displaced,
refer to [[Vowel length in Swedish]].

## Vowel paradigm
Using the convention taken by Riad[^2014],
we use the IPA symbol for the main long realisation of the vowel as the symbol for the phoneme.

- ‹i› /i/
- ‹y› /y/
- ‹e› /e/
- ‹ä› /ɛ/
  - \[+long +stressed] → \[ɛː]
    - → \[æ] / _ \[+retroflex]
  - \[+short +stressed] → \[ɛ]
- ‹ö› /ø/
- ‹u› /ʉ/
- ‹o› /u/
- ‹å› /o/
- ‹a› /ɑ/
