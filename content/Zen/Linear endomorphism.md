[[Linear map]]
# Linear endomorphism
A **linear operator** is an [[Morphism|endomorphism]] in a [[Category of vector spaces]],
i.e. a [[Linear map]] from a vector space into itself.
However the terminology is sometimes confused,
so I will stick with the term **linear endomorphism**.

In functional analysis, the differential operator $D$ is viewed as a linear operator on the vector space of functions.
