# Vowel Length in Swedish
Swedish has two phonemic vowel lengths: long and short.
Which length occurs can be predicted using the following categories[^2008]:

1. **V** — Stressed vowel in open syllables are **long**
    - _få_ /foː/ to get
1. **VC** — Stressed vowels followed by one consonant are **long**.
    - *får* /foːr/ get; sheep
1. **VCC** or **VCC** &c. — Stressed vowels followed by a long consonant group (two or more) are short.
    - _fått_ /fɔtː/ gotten
1. **Unstressed** — Always short
    - _tala_ /ˈtɑːˌla/ to speak
