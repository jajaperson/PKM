# $0$th-order logic

**$0$th-order logic**, often called **propositional logic**, refers to the part of logic dealing with [[proposition|propositions]] and connections between them (and no bound variables).
A **propositional calculus** is a [[formal system]] for manipulating 0th-order logic.

- [[Conventions of 0th-order logic in these notes]]

An alternative is (non dependent) [[Type theory]].
