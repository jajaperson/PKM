# Univalent Foundations

**Univalent Foundations** refers to a collection of proposed foundations of mathematics which take seriously the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] claim that isomorphic objects should be regarded as the same (see [[Univalence axiom]]).
In order to rigorously and consistently make this true, 
it must be possible for objects to be equal in more than one way 
(to reflect different identifications coming from different isomorphisms).
This has two important consequences on the kinds of foundational systems suitable for the cause:

- We are doing [[Proof-relevant mathematics]], which is naturally suited to the paradigm of [[Propositions as types]] as present in [[MLTT]] and its extensions
  — the isomorphism used to prove that two objects are identified needs to be retained in order to transport along that identification.
- [[Uniqueness of identity proofs|UIP]] is false, so we must take seriously the [[Anima-structure of types]]
  and the principles of [[Homotopy type theory]].

## Proposed foundations

- [[Book HoTT]]
- [[Cubical Type Theory]]
