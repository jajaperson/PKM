[[Category of fields]]
# Category of fields of characteristic $p$

The **category of fields of characteristic $p$** $\cat{Fld}_p$ is the [[subcategory]] of [[category of fields]] consisting of just those of [[characteristic]] $p$. #m/def/field 
These subcategories are completely disjoint in $\cat{Fld}$, thus
$$
\begin{align*}
\cat{Fld} = \coprod_{p = 0}^\infty \cat{Fld}_{p}
\end{align*}
$$
where $\cat{Fld}_{p}$ is empty iff $p$ is not prime.

## Properties

- The [[Initial and terminal objects|initial object]] of $\cat{Fld}_{p}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$ if $k=0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ if $p$ is prime by [[A field contains modular arithmetic or the rationals]].
