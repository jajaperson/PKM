[[Topological space]]
# Trivial topology
On any set $X$ the **trivial topology** of $X$ 
(also known as the **indiscrete topology**)
is one where only the empty set and the entire space $X$ are considered open
(and therefore also closed, since they are compliments of each other),
i.e. $\mathcal T = \{ \emptyset, X \}$.
Such a topology is the [[Coarseness and fineness of topologies|coarsest]] topology that can be formed on any set.
