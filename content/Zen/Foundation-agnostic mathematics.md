# Foundation-agnostic mathematics

Some parts of these notes aim to be foundation-agnostic.
This means we use language which may appropriately be interpreted in a variety of [[Foundation of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]],
such that the theorems given are true under each semantics.

It could be argued that the best way to be foundation-agnostic is to work in a [[type theory]] like [[MLTT]], which generally admits semantics for each foundational system.
We do not take this approach, for historical and pedagogical reasons.

## Foundation-agnostic terminology

- [[Collection]], [[Class]]
