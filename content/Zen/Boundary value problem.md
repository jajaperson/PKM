# Boundary value problem
A **boundary value problem** (BVP) gives the value of a function to be determined or its derivatives at multiple different points,
in contrast to an initial value problem which gives the value of a function and its derivatives at one point.

Unlike with IVPs, there is no general [[Existence and uniqueness theorem for IVPs]] for BVPs,
and they may have **no solutions, a unique solution, or infinite solutions** on a case by case basis.[^solns]

[^solns]: 2017\. [[Sources/@boyceElementaryDifferentialEquations2017|Elementary differential equations and boundary value problems]], p. 465

A non-homogenous system has a unique solution if and only if the only solution of the related homogenous system is the trivial solution $0$.
