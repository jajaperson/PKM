# PGmc weak verbs

The defining feature of **weak verbs** in PGmc is that they form using a dental suffix <em class="recon">-d-</em>.
All of the weak verbs share the same endings in the finite past and past participle, 
the variation is in the conjugation of the present 
and whether the past forms contain a linking vowel.

## Subclasses

See [[PGmc conjugation#Ringe's classification]]

- A. [[PGmc *bringaną-class]] with unsuffixed thematic present, past with no vowel before the suffix (usually thought of as irregular)
- B. [[PGmc *wurkijaną-class]] with presents in <em class="recon">-i-</em> ~ <em class="recon">-ja-</em>, past with no vowel before the suffix (subclass of weak I)
- C. [[PGmc *lagjaną-class]] with presents in <em class="recon">-i-</em> ~ <em class="recon">-ja-</em>, past with <em class="recon">-i-</em> before the suffix (main weak I)

- E. [[PGmc *sagjaną-class]] with presents in <em class="recon">-ai-</em> ~ <em class="recon">-ja-</em>, past with no vowel before the suffix (subclass of weak III)
