# System of linear ODEs
The theory of a system of linear ODEs shares much in common with the theory of a [[system of linear equations]].
A system of linear ODEs is one which may be written as
$$
\begin{align*}
\vab x' = P(t)\vab x + \vab g(t)
\end{align*}
$$
where $P : \mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{M}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\vab g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
This is also called a [[Differential system]].
