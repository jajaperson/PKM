# Quotient category

Given a [[category]] $\cat C$ and a [[congruence relation]] on hom-sets $\equiv$,
the **quotient category** $\cat C / {\equiv}$ has the same objects as $\cat C$ and congruence classes as morphisms, i.e.
$$
\begin{align*}
\cat C / {\equiv}(X,Y) = \{ [f] : f \in \cat C(X,Y) \}
\end{align*}
$$
## Examples

- [[Naïve homotopy category]] $\hTop = \Top / {\simeq}$ where $\simeq$ is [[Homotopy of maps]].
