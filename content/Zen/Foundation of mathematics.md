# Foundation of mathematics

According to [[Vladimir Voevodsky]][^2014], a foundation of mathematics as three components:

1. A formal deduction system: language and rules of manipulating sentences in this language that are purely formal, such that a record of such manipulations can be verified by a computer program;
2. A structure that provides a meaning to the sentences of this language in terms of mental objects intuitively comprehensible to humans;
3. A structure that enables humans to encode mathematical ideas in terms of the objects directly associated with the language.
