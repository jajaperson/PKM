# Euler-Lagrange equations

The **Euler-Lagrange** equations are partial differential equations characterizing stationary points under an [[action functional]].
These vary for different kinds of local Lagrangian, see

- [[Path Lagrangian]] for maximizing paths
- [[Scalar field Lagrangian]] for maximizing scalar fields
